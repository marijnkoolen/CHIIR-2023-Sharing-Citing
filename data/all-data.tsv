52L8KDC2	10.1145/3176349.3176875	Liu, Jingjing; Li, Yuan	Supporting Information Task Accomplishment: Helpful Systems and Their Features	2018	short	253-256	completed; design;method;questionnaire; design;type;descriptive; Vivien; domain;domain-agnostic; design;task; design;participants;32	helpful system features; task accomplishment; task outcome	We investigated systems and their features that help people use retrieved information to accomplish their information tasks. Participants were 32 college students who first recalled a recently accomplished task, and then worked on a task that they would need to finish. They answered questionnaire questions about what systems and features are helpful for task accomplishment. Our results discovered multiple helpful systems and features, which have implications on designing search systems for better helping accomplish tasks.

Goal-Directed Information Seeking in Time-Synchronized and Topic-Linked Records of the Apollo Lunar Missions	2017	short	269-272	completed; data;re-use;Apollo program resources; design;method;content analysis; design;method;interview; design;method;questionnaire; design;method;think-aloud; design;participants;5; design;task; design;type;descriptive; domain;research; infrastructure;share; infrastructure;share;Apollo Archive Explorer (AEX);http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~oard/apollo/aex; Vivien	apollo archive explorer; content linking; time synchronization; topic-linking; user study	We live in an era in which ubiquitous networks bring together information from a vast array of sources. The resulting confluence creates new opportunities for providing integrated access. This paper describes the use of a system for exploring the rich recorded legacy of the Apollo missions to the Moon, using the event structure of each mission as an organizing principle. Qualitative analysis of a study with five journalism students indicates that the system is capable of supporting goal-directed information seeking.

Lensing Wikipedia was designed as an alternate search and summarization interface, providing a set of ﬁltering, visualization, and exploration tools that enable searching among the connections between people, organizations, and locations. In this paper, we present the results of a user study on how these features are used in each of Vakkari’s stages of information seeking (pre-focus, focus formulation, and post-focus), and the participants perceptions of the utility of these features to their overall information-seeking goals. Participants primarily used input and control features during the pre-focus stage, informational and personalization features during the focus formulation stage, and personalization features during the post-focus stage. Findings from this study contribute to understanding how people use advanced search, summarization, and visualization tools to aid their information seeking tasks.

In this exploratory research, we investigate the association of topic familiarities with such QR strategies. We design a user study where 38 participants with different levels of Topic Familiarity (TF) took part in the TREC Genomics Search Track (a total of ﬁve search tasks). We conducted two experiments: 1) we evaluate a set of predeﬁned QR strategies to discover if participants with a speciﬁc level of TF tends to use a speciﬁc QR strategy. 2) we propose a supervised classiﬁcation system that classiﬁes consecutive queries made by the participants with different levels (low, medium, and high) of topic familiarity. Various lexical and distributional semantic features are implemented and feature analysis shows that participants with low familiarity tend to alter the spelling and use stemming for QR whereas participants with medium or higher familiarity are inclined to add new terms and phrases to reformulate queries.

In this paper, we examine two diﬀerent spatial representations of search results: knowledge graphs and hierarchical trees. Through interaction logs we show that knowledge graphs can eﬀectively reduce the need to read source content with no reduction in the quality of the information gathered by the user. Through qualitative interviews and thinkalounds we explore factors that inﬂuence user perception of diﬀerent search results representations including biases, task, perceived structure of the data, and problem-solving approach. Overall, these results enhance our understanding of the role each of these representations can play in information seeking.

However, case studies and observations from different domains including government, healthcare and legal, have suggested that CIR sometimes involves people with unequal access to information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level CIR (MLCIR). In addition to supporting collaboration, MLCIR systems must ensure that there is no unintended disclosure of sensitive information, this is an under investigated area of research. In this paper we present results of an evaluation of an interface we have designed for MLCIR scenarios. Pairs of participants used the interface under 3 different information access scenarios for a variety of search tasks. These scenarios included 1 CIR and 2 MLCIR scenarios, namely: full access (FA), document removal (DR) and term blacklisting (TR). Design interviews were conducted post evaluation to obtain qualitative feedback from participants. Evaluation results showed that our interface performed well for both DR and FA scenarios but for TR, team members with less access had a negative influence on their partner's search performance, demonstrating insights into how different MLCIR scenarios should be supported. Design interview results showed that our interface helped the participants to reformulate their queries, understand their partner's performance, reduce duplicated work and review their team's search history without disclosing sensitive information.
A3U96NBT	10.1145/3020165.3020175	Narang, Kanika; Dumais, Susan; Craswell, Nick; Liebling, Dan; Ai, Qingyao	Large-Scale Analysis of Email Search and Organizational Strategies	2017	long	215–223	completed; design;method;log analysis; design;type;descriptive; maria; domain;e-mail; data;Microsoft’s web email service; domain;personal information management	email management strategies; email search	Email continues to be an important form of communication as well as a way to manage tasks and archive personal information. As the volume of email grows, organizing and finding relevant email remains challenging. In this paper, we present a large-scale log analysis of the activities that people perform on email mes-sages (accessing external information via links or attachments, responding to messages, and organizing messages), their search behavior, and their organizational practices in a popular web email client. First, we characterize general email activities as well as activities associated with search. We find that within search sessions, peo-ple are more likely to access information and respond to messag-es but less likely to organize. Second, we examine the relation-ship between characteristics of a person's mailbox and their search and organizational practices. People with larger mailboxes tend to organize more, respond a little more, and access infor-mation less. People with larger mailboxes and folder structures search more, but the number of folders has less influence on search. Third, we extend previous work on email organization (e.g., filers vs. pilers; cleaners vs. keepers) by examining the extent to which these strategies are evident in our large-scale analysis and influence email activities and search. People who rely heavily on one organizational strategy tend to use others less. People who organize less tend to search more. Finally, we de-scribe how these insights can influence the design of email search.

Through constant use, new information flows are being defined around users' interactions with emails. Alongside traditional messages, the email inbox is an always-available repository of to-do lists, reminders, files and notes. In this paper, we investigate the use of self-addressed emails (self-Es) as an information management tool, by analysing both: (i) responses to a survey about email use; and (ii) a collection of user donated self-addressed emails. Our results show that sending self-Es is a frequent behaviour among the users we questioned. In addition, we find that to-dos and reminders are the most popular type of information contained in emails-to-self. Our findings have direct implications for the development of systems that support novel interactions with information flows centred around email.

Participants engaged with news stories and completed knowledge retention tests to evaluate their ability to remember the content. We analyzed how the stories and the way in which they were presented (audio, video, text) related to knowledge retention. Results demonstrated a complex interaction between topic and knowledge retention, where participants obtained higher scores for the least preferred story. We explored these findings with respect to participants' demographics and user experience.

The authors argue that the search engine results page (SERP) exposes three important types of bias: source bias, algorithmic bias, and cognitive bias. To explore the relationship between these three types of bias, we conducted a mixed methods study with sixty participants (plus fourteen in a pilot to make a total of seventy-four participants). Within a library setting, participants were provided with mock search engine pages that presented order-controlled sources on a science controversy. Participants were then asked to rank the sources' usefulness and then summarize the controversy. We found that participants ranked the usefulness of sources depending on its presentation within a SERP. In turn, this also influenced how the participants summarized the topic. We attribute the differences in the participants' writings to the cognitive biases that affect a user's judgment when selecting sources on a SERP. We identify four main cognitive biases that a SERP can evoke in students: Priming, Anchoring, Framing, and the Availability Heuristic. While policing information quality is a quixotic task, changes can be made to both SERPs and a user's decision-making when selecting sources. As bias emerges both on the system side and the user side of search, we suggest a two-fold solution is required to address these challenges.

Breaking the Vicious Cycle by Finding Struggling Students in Community Question-Answering	2017	long	165–174	completed; maria; design;method;content analysis;forum posts; design;type;predictive; domain;question answering; design;method;categorization; data;Brainly.com	education; community question-answering (cqa); features; struggling user	Community Question Answering (CQA) services have become popular methods to seek and share information. In CQA, users with an information need, or askers, post a question that community members can answer. This question-answering process allows both askers and answerers to learn through the exchange of information. CQA services have also been widely used in the education domain, as some of such services are designed specifically for students' information seeking. However, due to insufficient knowledge, lack of experience, and other reasons, students often struggle in producing quality or even appropriate content. This low quality production causes their content to be flagged or deleted, further discouraging them from participating in the CQA process and instigating a vicious cycle of bad users and bad content. In an effort to break this cycle, the work reported here focuses on identifying users whose postings demonstrate a high deletion rate with a presumption that the bad content is an indication of a struggling student rather than a malicious user. In this work, experiments are conducted on a large student-oriented online CQA community to understand struggling students' behaviors. A framework is proposed to find these users based solely on their activities. Finally, community feedback (i.e. human judgment) such as moderator evaluation or community votes for good content is used to detect these users in the early stages of their respective struggles. To evaluate this framework, we used data from Brainly, a large educational CQA service that is used in two different markets with more than 3.7 million users and 10.7 million answers. The results show that the human judgment feature identifies early-stage struggling users with high accuracy. Identifying these struggling users (students) could help educators to determine suitable ways to help their students instead of presuming them to be bad users and cutting them off from the community.

Social signals associated with web resources (documents) can be considered as an additional information that can play a vital role to estimate a priori importance of these resources. Particularly, we are interested in the freshness of signals and their diversity. We hypothesize that the moment (the date) when the user actions occur and the diversity of actions may impact the search performance. We propose to model these heterogeneous social features as document prior. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by carrying out extensive experiments on two different INEX datasets, namely SBS and IMDb, enriched with several social signals collected from social networks. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the interest of integrating fresh and diverse signals in the retrieval process.
6935GU8V	10.1145/3020165.3020169	Wilson, Max L.	The Tetris Model of Resolving Information Needs within the Information Seeking Process	2017	long	147–154	completed; toine; design;type;theoretical; domain;IIR; domain;information seeking; infrastructure;software;Tetris	information need; information seeking process; model; theory	Theoretical abstractions, of many different aspects of search, have played a crucial role in driving research into human information seeking and retrieval forward. From models of the Information Seeking Process, to how we perceive search systems, these models help us to 1) conceptually formalise and separate aspects of the model's focus, 2) communicate more clearly about these aspects, 3) create hypotheses for subsequent research, and 4) produce implications for future systems. Implicit in these four aspects is that models and theories should have a focus and a purpose. After clarifying the relationships between models, theories, and meta-theories, this perspectives paper introduces the Tetris Model of Resolving Information Needs within the Information Seeking Process, the purpose of which is to better represent the behaviours around the Human Computer Interaction with Information Retrieval, which are often confounded within stage-based models of the Information Seeking Process. In particular, the possible sequence of actions performed by a searcher are typically linearly aligned from left-to-right, and thus imply a temporal progression. The differing focus of the Tetris model is to better capture the temporal experience of searching, by removing the implied progression of left-to-right. The aim of this perspectives paper, therefore, is to introduce this new Tetris Model, such that it can be used to formalise people's interactive experiences in a new way, so that we can more clearly communicate about them, create hypotheses from the model, and consider novel design implications based upon it.
F3GAVP8A	10.1145/3020165.3020176	Jiang, Jiepu; He, Daqing; Kelly, Diane; Allan, James	Understanding Ephemeral State of Relevance	2017	long	137–146	design;method;controlled experiment; completed; design;method;questionnaire; design;type;explanatory; design;method;log analysis; design;type;descriptive; design;method;user study; domain;WWW; Vivien; domain;domain-agnostic; design;task; design;participants;28; design;re-use;task from TREC session track	relevance judgment; usefulness; user experience; web search	Despite its dynamic nature, relevance is often measured in a context-independent manner in information retrieval practice. We look into this discrepancy. We propose a contextual relevance/usefulness measurement called ephemeral state of relevance (ESR), which is defined as the amount of useful information a user acquired from a clicked result as assessed just after examining the result during an interactive search session. We collect ESR and context-independent usefulness judgments through a laboratory user study and compare the two. We examine factors related to both judgments and examine their differences. Our study demonstrates a few advantages of ESR: it captures users' real-time state of mind and perceptions; it measures how much useful information the user is able to acquire from a result rather than how much there is in the result; it better reflects users' needs and criteria of useful results during a session, highlighting novelty as a salient factor. However, we also find that users may not be able to correctly assess the credibility of information during a session, which may reduce the reliability of the collected ESR judgments. We evaluate ESR, context-independent usefulness judgments, and TREC-style topical relevance judgments by correlating with user experience in a session. The results demonstrate that switching the judgment criterion from topical relevance to usefulness is fruitful, but moving from context-independent judgments to contextual ones has only limited advantages with respect to its cost and complexity. Our study enriches current understanding on the dynamics of relevance in a search session and identifies both opportunities and challenges for collecting contextual relevance judgments.

Recently, much effort has been made to directly model key aspects of users' interactions with search system, for example, Benefit and Cost. Time has been widely adopted in both of the two aspects since benefit and cost must be expressed in meaningful units in practical application. Psychological studies have demonstrated that the subjectively perceived time might be different from the objective time measured by timing device and the time perception process of human beings is affected by some psychological factors, such as motivation and interest, which are closely related to the search process. Considering that time is usually used to describe the subject experience of search users, it is necessary to investigate the difference between perceived time and objective time in search process. In psychology, there is a temporal illusion effect named Vierordt's law, i.e. shorter intervals tend to be overestimated while longer intervals tend to be underestimated. In this work, we carefully designed a lab-study to examine the impact of duration length on user's time perception in the context of search. Experimental results show that Vierordt's law is consistently observed in Web search environment. This work could help us to correct the estimation of users' perceived time and provide insights about the mechanism of satisfaction.
TTYP2S6Z	10.1145/3020165.3020183	Radlinski, Filip; Craswell, Nick	A Theoretical Framework for Conversational Search	2017	long	117–126	completed; toine; domain;WWW; design;type;theoretical; domain;tourism; domain;conversational agents; domain;e-commerce; domain;personal information	chatbot; conversational search; personal agent	This paper studies conversational approaches to information retrieval, presenting a theory and model of information interaction in a chat setting. In particular, we consider the question of what properties would be desirable for a conversational information retrieval system so that the system can allow users to answer a variety of information needs in a natural and efficient manner. We study past work on human conversations, and propose a small set of properties that taken together could measure the extent to which a system is conversational. Following this, we present a theoretical model of a conversational system that implements the properties. We describe how this system could be implemented, making the action space of an conversational search agent explicit. Our analysis of this model shows that while theoretical, the model could be practically implemented to satisfy the desirable properties presented. In doing so, we show that the properties are also feasible.

In this paper, we introduce a novel tool that exploits the structural properties for extracting and visualizing the underlying topics in a given dataset. To this end, we make use of a combination of latent topic analysis, discriminative feature selection applied on top of the category structure of corpora, and various ranking methods in order to extract the most representative topics for a given corpus. The visual moniker to depict the outcome of these methods can be chosen based on the context. Such visual representations can be useful for depicting trends, identifying ``hot'' topics, and discovering interesting patterns in the underlying data. As applications, we create example representations for a variety of corpora obtained from conference proceedings, movie summaries, and newsgroup postings. Our user experiments demonstrate the viability of our approach, with a flower-like visualization inspired by the ``wheel of emotion'', for generating high quality representative topics and for unearthing hidden structures and connections in large document corpora.

Search engines have been improved to reduce users' effort in web search, e.g., providing flexible snippet sizes by considering the purpose of the search and suggesting predicted answers. In most cases, search engines for mobile devices present two or three lines of snippet for each result link. Some studies suggest that long snippets provide a better search experience on desktop screens, but this may not be true for mobile devices because of the smaller screen. We conducted a user study to investigate what size of snippet is appropriate for mobile devices. Our findings suggest that users with long snippets on mobile devices exhibit longer search times with no better search accuracy for informational tasks. This is caused by the longer reading time, frequent scrolling with bigger viewport movements, and greater time consumption for searching and reading one result. The overall findings suggest that, unlike desktop users, mobile users are best served by snippets of two to three lines.

In this paper, we conduct an investigation into modeling two kinds of search activities: exploratory activities and fact-finding activities during web search. Specifically, we consider the case where a user is conducting consecutive fact-finding searches on multiple topics. This information behavior is also known as multitasking search. The goal of our research is to build models of users' web information-seeking behavior in order to differentiate between search activities caused by exploratory search tasks and consecutive fact-finding search tasks while users are still searching. In order to build search process models, we have designed and conducted a user study where the participants interact with a common web search engine. Based on the gathered log data, we built search models based on (Hidden) Markov Models and analyze the results. Our results yield to classification rates between 73.6% and 92.1% using different Markov Models and different data configurations. Furthermore, even with interaction sequences of a limited length, the models reach a classification rate of 85.6% within the first four interactions and about 89% with 30 and more interactions. Using a reduced data set the models still reach an accuracy of 87.7%. That is, within a single session the trained models can be used to detect the search activity to provide appropriate user support.

In lab studies, users typically perform a designed task under a controlled environment, which may not reflect their natural behaviour. While log analysis allows the observation of users' natural search behaviour, often strong assumptions need to be made in order to associate the unobserved underlying user tasks with log signals. We describe a field study during which we log participants' daily search and browsing activities for 5 days, and users are asked to self-annotate their search logs with the tasks they conducted as well as to describe the task characteristics according to a conceptual task classification scheme. This provides us with a more realistic and comprehensive view on how user tasks are associated with logged interactions than seen in previous log- or lab-based studies; and allows us to explore the complex interactions between task characteristics and their presence in naturalistic tasks which has not been studied previously. We find a higher number of queries, longer timespan, as well as more task switches than reported in previous log based studies; and 41% of our tasks are zero-query tasks implying that large amounts of user task activities remain unobserved when only focused on query logs. Further, tasks sharing similar descriptions can vary greatly in their characteristics, suggesting that when supporting users with their tasks, it is important to know not only the task they are engaged with but also the context of the user in the task.

In multi-aspect search, the information need of the user consists of more than one aspect or query simultaneously. While visualization and interactive search user interface techniques for improving user interpretation of search results have been proposed, the current research lacks understanding on how useful these are for the user: whether they lead to quantifiable benefits in perceiving the result space and allow faster, and more precise retrieval. Our technique visualizes relevance and document density on a two-dimensional map with respect to the query phrases. Pointing to a location on the map specifies a weight distribution of the relevance to each of the query phrases, according to which search results are re-ranked. User experiments compared our technique to a uni-dimensional search interface with typed query and ranked result list, in perception and retrieval tasks. Visual re-ranking yielded improved accuracy in perception, higher precision in retrieval and overall faster task execution. Our findings demonstrate the utility of visual re-ranking, and can help designing search user interfaces that support multi-aspect search.

Attempts have been made to replicate or replace it online, however they have not typically been based on a principled understanding of the goals and behaviours of readers. This paper addresses the behaviour of readers, presenting an empirical examination of the mechanics of library shelf browsing. We note some previously undescribed behaviours, such as placemarking, and some hitherto unknown details such as the large number of books browsers consider. We situate our findings in the literature, and use them to drive design recommendations.

Most existing data on the use of library books uses logs to quantify loans, or user interviews to obtain insights into their use. We deploy a new specialised technique, photographing library shelves systematically over a week-long period, and noting the changes to the positioning of individual books, and each shelf as a whole. Through this indirect observation, we demonstrate the use of shelved books within, rather than on leaving, the library. We reveal the first insight into within-library book use, and demonstrate that in-library use appears to be more common and over a longer period than previous research suggests.

This perspectives paper examines the development, evaluation, and application of questionnaires in IIR research. The authors draw upon prior literature and their own research to explore how to best construct and extract meaning from questionnaires. Since building IIR knowledge and theories requires the employment of valid, reliable, dimensional, and sensitive self-report measures, this paper's contribution is an overview of best practices for developing, administering, and analyzing questionaires.

SearchGazer is a pure JavaScript library that infers the gaze behavior of searchers in real time. The eye tracking model self-calibrates by watching searchers interact with the search pages and trains a mapping of eye features to gaze locations and search page elements on the screen. Contrary to typical eye tracking studies in information retrieval, this approach does not require the purchase of any additional specialized equipment, and can be done remotely in a user's natural environment, leading to cheaper and easier visual attention studies. While SearchGazer is not intended to be as accurate as specialized eye trackers, it is able to replicate many of the research findings of three seminal information retrieval papers: two that used eye tracking devices, and one that used the mouse cursor as a restricted focus viewer. Charts and heatmaps from those original papers are plotted side-by-side with SearchGazer results. While the main results are similar, there are some notable differences, which we hypothesize derive from improvements in the latest ranking technologies used by current versions of search engines and diligence by remote users. As part of this paper, we also release SearchGazer as a library that can be integrated into any search page.

Accordingly, user interests in a digital library for the social sciences are manifold. In this study we analyzed nine years log data of a social science digital library to get an overview of the fields, categories, topics and detailed information needs users are interested in. Based on the log data we have built interactive visualizations which give an overview and concurrently let us look at the detailed interests of users. The underlying log data and the created visualizations are then used to analyze user interests at different hierarchical levels and on a temporal view. The results show that there are topical interests of the users in specific fields and topics of the social sciences but at the same time there exists a diversity of different information needs. Based on these findings we analyze in detail the gap between the indexing language of the system used to annotate documents and the language users apply to articulate their information needs.

Recently, some approaches have proposed entity based extraction of tasks, where they either use entities as features or construct task dictionaries that contain multiple tasks. While text based features do not exploit entities directly, task dictionaries do not provide concise or distinct representation of tasks. We overcome these shortcomings by extracting category oriented tasks by exploiting properties of an existing, publicly available category hierarchy. We evaluate quality of these tasks with implicit, explicit and application based evaluation. Empirical evaluation shows that category based task extraction results in more accurate and useful tasks.

Preliminary user studies with professional electronic music producers point up the frustration and laboriousness of finding suitable drum samples in the increasingly large libraries of sounds available, and suggest the need for alternative interfaces and approaches. To address this issue, two novel spatial visualizations (respectively organized by name and by timbre-similarity) are designed as potential alternatives to the traditional 1D list-based browsers. These visualizations are implemented and compared in a music creation task, in terms of both the exploration experience and the resulting production quality, within a system for drum kit configuration. Our study shows that spatial visualizations do improve the overall exploration experience, and reveals the potential of similarity-based arrangements for the support of creative processes.

However, reliable measures of experience in these cases are limited. Other areas of information interaction, e.g., online search, news, and shopping, are increasingly exploring and attempting to measure the concept of user engagement (UE). In this study, we ask whether UE is an appropriate outcome for the utilitarian activities of online form-filling and transactions. We describe work in progress which measures UE using the User Engagement Scale (UES) with utilitarian tasks, and which looks for behaviours which correlate with the UES. Early results suggest that, first, the UES can be adapted to such situations; and second, that readily observable user behaviours including time on site, mouse movements, and keypresses correlate with UES sub-scales and can, to some extent, predict users' responses.

The selection of sources for health information has significant implications for people's healthcare decision-making. However, little is known about how individual differences influence users' selection of online sources for health information. This study intends to fill this gap by exploring the impact of a number of individual characteristics on users' selection of five online sources (search engines, social Q&A sites, social networking sites (SNSs), online health communities, and crowdsourcing sites) for three distinct types of health-related search task (factual, exploratory, and personal experiences). We found that individuals' health literacy and frequency of using a source are the most significant predictors of their source selections across task types. Preference for information has an impact on users' selection of SNSs for exploratory tasks. Extraversion personality has an impact on users' selection of search engines for tasks that seek personal experiences. Nevertheless, demographic factors, including gender, income, and health status, do not predict users' selection of online sources for health information.

Accurate prediction of user performance with search systems must incorporate a means to model how users switch between different information sources. For example, a search session may consist of multiple queries with the user making decisions of when to switch from evaluating the current result list to a new result list produced by a query reformulation. Likewise, users may switch to a result list produced by a query suggestion or other interaction mechanism that produces a new search result list. In this paper, we simulate user behavior and investigate optimal switching behavior for a user who must decide when and if to issue their current query to another search engine. As a first step in understanding the problem space, we restrict our investigation and discussion to two top performing runs submitted to the TREC 2005 Robust track. We find four classes of switching behavior that a user would be faced with in making a decision about whether to switch from one result list to another.

Five physicians performed two simulated clinical scenarios consisting of 9 tasks using the EHR. Tasks were categorized into simple vs. complex tasks based on the user, task and context characteristics by the subject matter expert. Usability was assessed using four methods, (1) subjectively using subject's informal feedback and usability expert's heuristics, (2) workload measures using eye tracking, (3) behavior measures using clicks and navigation windows, and (4) performance measures using actual time on task and predictive time based on CogTool ©. Overall, the results suggest that heuristic methods (1) are highly effective in identifying usability issues, with other methods (2-4) providing complementary analysis to identify differences is task complexly and user experience with EHRs.

In order to allow system comparisons the many factors that influence relevance are often discarded to allow abstraction to a single score relating to relevance. This means that a great wealth of information is often discarded. In this paper we outline the creation of a video test collection with graded relevance assessments, to the best of our knowledge the first example of such a test collection for video retrieval. To directly address the shortcoming above we also gathered behavioural and perceptual data from assessors during the assessment process. All of this information along with judgements are available for download. Our intention is to allow other researchers to supplement the judgements to help create an adaptive test collection which contains supplementary information rather than a completely static collection with binary judgements.

But there are many situations where Internet resources do not have a one-to-one mapping with URIs. For URIs that point to the first page of a document that has been broken up over multiple pages, users are likely to consider the whole article as the resource, even though it is spread across multiple URIs. Comments, tags, ratings, and advertising might or might not be perceived as part of the resource whether they are retrieved as part of the primary URI or accessed via a link. Similarly, whether content accessible via links, tabs, or other navigation available at the primary URI is perceived as part of the resource may depend on the design of the website. We are examining what people believe are the bounds of Internet resources with the hope of informing systems that better match user perceptions. To understand this challenge we explore a situation where the user is assumed to have identified a resource by a URI, particularly for archiving. To begin to answer these questions, we asked 110 participants how desirable it would be for web contents related to an identified archived resource to also be archived. Results indicate that the features important to this decision likely vary considerably from resource to resource.

Many languages, however, lack the language tuned preprocessing tools that are needed to create indexing terms for speech. One approach in such cases is to rely on repetition, detected using acoustic features, to find terms that might be worth indexing. Experiments have shown that this approach yields term sets that might be sufficient for some applications in both spoken term detection and ranked retrieval experiments. Such approaches currently work only with spoken queries, however, and only when the searcher is able to speak in a manner similar to that of the speakers in the collection. This demonstration paper proposes Vapor Engine, a new tool for selectively transcribing repeated terms that can be automatically detected from spoken content in any language. These transcribed terms could then be matched to queries formulated using written terms. Vapor Engine is early in development: it currently supports only single-term queries and has not yet having been formally evaluated. This paper introduces the interface and summarizes the challenges it seeks to address.

In this work, we quantify multi-tasking behavior of web search users. Using insights from large-scale search logs, we seek to characterize user groups and search sessions with a focus on multi-task sessions. Our findings show that dual-task sessions are more prevalent than single-task sessions in online search, and that over 50\% of search sessions have more than 2 tasks. Further, we provide a method to categorize users into focused, multi-taskers or supertaskers depending on their level of task-multiplicity and show that the search effort expended by these users varies across the groups. The findings from this analysis provide useful insights about task-multiplicity in an online search environment and hold potential value for search engines that wish to personalize and support search experiences of users based on their task behavior.

In most of the previous works, time is usually an objective factor measured by timing devices. However, the time perceived by user seems more intuitive to describe the impact of time because search user's opinion is considered subjective. Psychological researches have reported that time perception can be affected by many physical and psychological factors. In this work, a laboratory study with 50 participants was adopted to investigate the impact of Temporal Relevance, e.g., the awareness of elapsed time, on time perception of Web search users. Experimental results show that participants in high temporal relevance environments tend to perceive significantly longer task durations than the actual ones. It shows that the perception of time can be manipulated in Web search scenario and reveals the necessity to take the factor of user perception into consideration in time-related Web search researches such as effort-based evaluation.

For information science, it is important to understand how these unconscious processes play a role in information seeking. The current study uses subliminal psychodynamic activation (SPA), through the use of subliminal messages that appeared below the threshold of conscious awareness, to investigate the influence of the unconscious in information searching. Twenty-four college students participated in a controlled laboratory experiment, each searching freely on the Internet for information for three search tasks, with various SPA messages appearing in each search. Participants were systematically assigned to one of the four SPA conditions with various subliminal messages. Users' perceptions of search task topic interest, topic knowledge and task difficulty was examined between different SPA conditions, as well as the change of users' perceptions on topic interest, knowledge, and difficulty before and after searching in different SPA conditions. Findings suggested that users' pre- and post-task ratings of topic interest, knowledge, and difficulty did not show significant differences among the 4 SPA conditions. However, the change in users' perceptions of topic interest and topic knowledge before and after searching showed significant differences when SPA messages were present. Our findings inspire future research in this underexplored field.

The system-oriented metrics include session-based DCG (sDCG), normalized sDCG (nsDCG), estimated session nDCG (esNDCG), and a few variants of these metrics. We also look into statistics (e.g., the mean, maximum, and minimum values) of individual queries' nDCG scores, as well as the first and the last query's nDCG in a session. These system-oriented metrics are compared with users' self-rated search performance and task difficulty for a session. Experimental results show that nsDCG and esNDCG have reasonable but weak correlations with the user metrics, while the worst and the last query's nDCG in a session have comparably strong correlations. This suggests future work may better measure users' search experience in a session by modeling each query in the session differently.

The following presents the anatomical reasoning behind incorporating additional gaze features, the integration of the additional features into an existing interest modeling architecture, and a plan for assessing the impact of the addition of the features.

To understand users' behavior and their interests in the cultural heritage domain, we have logged onsite user interaction logs of visits in a museum. This prompts the question on the reliability of the social information being gathered from the onsite logs: How does the position of museum objects affect users' behavior in the museum? How does order of visiting point of interests affect their dwell-time in front of each point of interest? How do different users' characteristics affect their behavior in the museum? In short, what are different kinds of biases that should be considered in the onsite logs? Our main findings are the following: First, there is a considerable position bias, which is due to the design of the exhibition and should be considered during extraction of social signals from the log. Second, there is a bias in the amount of time that users spend for interacting with the point of interests and the order of picking them to visit. This shows a fatigue on users' interactions while they are reaching to the end of the exhibition. Third, we find out some variations among the users' visit, which shows context is an important factor to consider while using onsite logs for different purposes.

However, the ability to search is limited by the query box and search results list paradigm. In this paper, we propose TwIST (Twitter Information Search Tool), which has been designed to support interactive search and exploration within Twitter. TwIST is a mobile application that works in two modes: simple search and exploratory search. The searcher can easily change between these modes by rotating the device, making it easy to access the mode that will support the desired search activity. While the simple search mode is dominated by the common search results list format, the exploratory search mode uses topic modelling, visualization, and interactive filtering to support the searcher in finding the information they are seeking.

In this paper we present preliminary results from a larger study focused on immersive interaction with digital information objects. In particular, we report those derived from a user study designed to evaluate interactions with digital information objects through body gestures in the context of an image search task. Our results suggest that compared to traditional interactions through mouse, this type of interaction not only helps lessen cognitive workload, but also leads to achieve similar precision in terms of the information collected.

In particular, touch-based interfaces enable users to use their own fingers to manipulate and interact with digital objects in a more direct fashion than mouse-based interactions. However, it is not clear yet to what extent, if any, this type of interaction could help bridge the gap between users and the digital world in particular information-related contexts such as information search. In this paper we report preliminary results of a user study designed to compare mouse and touch-based interactions in the context of an image search task. This study is part of a larger research project focused on immersive interaction with digital information objects. Our results show that in spite of the novelty, high adoption rates, and tangible nature of touch-based interfaces, no significant differences exist with prevalent technology (i.e., mouse) in terms of performance; nevertheless, user experience was found to better in touch-based interactions.

However, research on multilingual systems has generally focused on the user interface's language rather than the content language. In this paper, we describe and compare early results from the multilingual aspects in the Interactive Social Book Search (iSBS) task at CLEF 2014 and 2015. A preliminary analysis of usage patterns for native English and non-native English speakers indicates an influence of language skills on search behaviour during goal-oriented and casual leisure tasks. Based on previous experiences and results, strengths and challenges of IIR studies are discussed.

The user of a speech-based information delivery system, for example a text-to-speech system, usually cannot interrupt the ongoing information flow, inhibiting her/him to confirm some part of the content, or to pose an inquiry for further information exploration. We argue that a carefully designed spoken dialog system could remedy these undesirable situations, and further enable an enjoyable conversation with the users. The key technologies to realize such an attractive dialog system are: (1) pre-compilation of a dialog plan based on the analysis of a source content, and (2) the dynamic recognition of user's state of understanding and interests. This paper illustrates technical views to implement these functionalities, and discusses a dialog example to exemplify the technical merits of the proposed system.

However, there is not much guidance about how to identify interesting tasks or how interest in a task impacts search behaviors and experiences, which is the purpose of this study. In this study, we created eight work tasks and asked forty participants to rank these tasks from most interesting to least interesting before they came into the lab for an IIR experiment. During the experiment, we asked participants to conduct searches for the two tasks they ranked as most interesting and the two they ranked as least interesting. Participants completed pre- and post-search questionnaires to characterize their interests in the tasks and their search experiences, including engagement. Participants rated their interest, prior knowledge and search experience, and the relevancy of interesting tasks significantly higher than uninteresting tasks. They also predicted these tasks would be significantly less difficult to complete. Participants reported significantly greater engagement with interesting tasks and they spent longer completing these tasks. However, there were no significant differences in participants' search behaviors including number of queries issued, number of SERPs, or number of documents bookmarked. These results provide evidence that our method of assigning tasks to participants that would interest and engage them, at least cognitively, if not behaviorally, was somewhat successful. This method can be used by others conducting laboratory IIR studies.

Personal profiles are often sparse, due to cold start problems and the fact that users typically search for new items or information, necessitating to back-off to customization, but group profiles often suffer from accidental features brought in by the unique individual contributing to the group. In this paper we propose a generalized group profiling approach that teases apart the exact contribution of the individual user level and the `abstract' group level by extracting a latent model that captures all, and only, the essential features of the whole group. Our main findings are the followings. First, we propose an efficient way of group profiling which implicitly eliminates the general and specific features from users' models in a group and takes out the abstract model representing the whole group. Second, we employ the resulting models in the task of contextual suggestion. We analyse different grouping criteria and we find that group-based suggestions improves the customization. Third, we see that the granularity of groups affects the quality of group profiling. We observe that grouping approach should compromise between the level of customization and groups' size.

These questionnaires often contain ad hoc sets of items in part because there are no valid and reliable measures of search experience. In this paper, we present results of an exploratory factor analysis of 327 responses to a 14-item Search Self-Efficacy scale (SSE) that we have been using as a way to measure search experience in our research. The responses come from eight different interactive information retrieval (IIR) studies, which we have conducted over the last six years, with a variety of participant types: university students, participants from the general adult population and crowd-sourced participants. The purpose of this analysis is to understand the variation in search self-efficacy scores across different types of people and to evaluate the potential of the SSE scale as a tool for measuring search experience. Overall, participants from all eight studies reported similar levels of search self-efficacy; the overall average from all eight studies was 7.47 (items scored on a 10-point scale) with little variance (standard deviation=1.36). Both the lowest and highest scores (7.1 and 7.8) were observed in studies involving the general adult population. A factor analysis showed that the questionnaire items load onto six factors, although only four had sufficient numbers of items loading on them. These four factors represent overall task success, effective use of time, query development skills, and advanced search skills.

Instead, those wishing to measure search expertise often include a single item that asks people to indicate how often they search or for how long they have been searching. In this paper, we report initial results of a four-phase study aimed at developing a measure of search expertise. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with nine professional searchers and an inventory of items related to online search expertise was created. While participants identified a number of usual items for determining search expertise, such as prior search experience, domain knowledge and resource knowledge, they also identified a large number of items related to personality characteristics such as persistence, flexibility, curiosity, adaptability and humility. These results suggest that measuring personality characteristics in addition to experience and knowledge might help determine who will be a more successful searcher. In today's search environments, where many people describe themselves as experts, representing these types of characteristics in a measure of search expertise might allow researchers and practitioners to observe more variation in populations of interest, design more effective instruction and make better predictions about search outcomes.

In addition to the construction of test collections, relevance judging is critical to e-discovery and other applications where many assessors are hired to perform relevance judging. It is well known that assessors may differ in their judgements for a given document. One possible cause of a judgement difference is that an assessor may be uncertain in their judgement and thus may in effect be guessing the document's relevance. If assessors are aware of their uncertainty and can self-report their level of certainty, then uncertain relevance judgements can be targeted for adjudication by additional assessors. In this paper, we conducted a user study with 48 participants to test our hypothesis that assessors will be uncertain about their relevance judgements when the assessors are likely to disagree with each other. We found that for low consensus documents, i.e. documents known for assessor disagreement, assessors judge these documents with almost as much certainty as high consensus documents. In particular, assessor self-reported uncertainty is predictive of disagreement only for high consensus documents and not for low consensus documents.

Platforms like Wikipedia act as information conduits through which informational elements (e.g. topic pages) cater to the information seeking needs of users worldwide. While usage data from these informational elements help us to predict the information seeking behavior of users, especially in reaction to external news events, what has been largely ignored in past literature is the predictive value of the underlying informational network that connects these elements. In this study, we uncover causal linkages in information seeking behavior among related informational elements on Wikipedia. We demonstrate that incorporating this causal information leads to better predictions of page view counts of relevant Wikipedia pages, when compared to models that ignore such underlying causal linkages. We also provide additional evidence about the efficacy of our approach from the real world, by performing a judgment study with human annotators. This research is among the first to investigate and uncover the value of understanding the underlying relationships among informational elements.

The main contributing factors for the lack of mainstream adoption can be attributed to the perception that Topic Modeling produces topics of poor quality and that content analysts do not trust the derived topics because they are unable to supply domain knowledge and interact with the algorithm. In this paper, interactive Topic Modeling algorithms namely Dirichlet-Forrest Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Penalised Non-negative Matrix Factorisation, are evaluated with respect to their ability to aid qualitative content analysis. More specifically, the relationship between interactivity, interpretation, topic coherence and trust in interactive content analysis is examined. The findings indicate that providing content analysts with the ability to interact with Topic Modeling algorithms produces topics that are directly related to their research questions. However, a number of improvements to these algorithms were also identified which have the potential to influence future algorithm development to better meet the requirements of qualitative content analysts.

Ebook technology means that borrowing can take different forms, for example printing and reading. We do not know, though, which of these options readers actually use. Ebook technology generates logs that allow us to understand ebook borrowing patterns over time, both by individual readers and in aggregate. Despite the ready availability of ebook logs, this area remains under-researched. In this paper we present an exploratory log analysis of ebook borrowing, comparing printing and reading, discovery patterns, single- and multiple-book sessions and identifying specific borrowing patterns.

Though understanding such search behavior is necessary for the development of search engines that specifically support writing tasks, it has neither been systematically recorded nor analyzed. This paper contributes part of the missing research: We report on the outcomes of a large-scale corpus construction initiative to acquire detailed interaction logs of writers who were given a writing task on 150 pre-defined TREC topics. The corpus is freely available to foster research on exploratory search. Each essay is at least 5000 words long and comes with a chronological log of search queries, result clicks, web browsing trails, and fine-grained writing revisions that reflect the task completion status. To ensure reproducibility, a fully-fledged, static web search environment has been created on top of the ClueWeb09 corpus as part of our initiative. In this paper, we present initial analyses of the recorded search interaction logs and overview insights gained from them: (1) essay writing behavior corresponds to search patterns that are rather stable for the same writer, (2) fact-checking queries often conclude a writing task, (3) recurring anchor queries are often submitted to not lose the main themes or to explore new directions, (4) query terms can be learned while searching and reading, (5) the number of submitted queries is not a good indicator for task completion.

While searching for articles published over time, a key preference is to retrieve documents which cover the important aspects from important points in time which is different from standard search behavior. To support this search strategy, we introduce the notion of a Historical Query Intent to explicitly model a historian's search task and define an aspect-time diversification problem over news archives. We present a novel algorithm, HistDiv, that explicitly models the aspects and important time windows based on a historian's information seeking behavior. By incorporating temporal priors based on publication times and temporal expressions, we diversify both on the aspect and temporal dimensions. We test our methods by constructing a test collection based on The New York Times Collection with a workload of 30 queries of historical intent assessed manually. We find that HistDiv outperforms all competitors in subtopic recall with a slight loss in precision. We also present results of a qualitative user study to determine wether this drop in precision is detrimental to user experience. Our results show that users still preferred HistDiv's ranking.

Within the field a generally accepted conception of relevance as inherently subjective has emerged, with an individual's assessment of relevance influenced by numerous contextual factors. In this paper we present a user study that examines in detail the differences between primary and secondary assessors on a set of ""real-world"" topics which were gathered specifically for the work. By gathering topics which are representative of the staff and students at a major university, at a particular point in time, we aim to explore differences between primary and secondary relevance judgements for real-life search tasks. Findings suggest that while secondary assessors may find the assessment task challenging in various ways (they generally possess less interest and knowledge in secondary topics and take longer to assess documents), agreement between primary and secondary assessors is high.

We describe a lab-based user study in which we investigated potential indicators of learning in web searching, effective query strategies for learning, and the relationship between search behavior and learning outcomes. Using questionnaires, analysis of written responses to knowledge prompts, and search log data, we found that searchers' perceived learning outcomes closely matched their actual learning outcomes; that the amount searchers wrote in post-search questionnaire responses was highly correlated with their cognitive learning scores; and that the time searchers spent per document while searching was also highly and consistently correlated with higher-level cognitive learning scores. We also found that of the three query interaction conditions we applied, an intrinsically diverse presentation of results was associated with the highest percentage of users achieving combined factual and conceptual knowledge gains. Our study provides deeper insight into which aspects of search interaction are most effective for supporting superior learning outcomes, and the difficult problem of how learning may be assessed effectively during Web search.

The applicability and performance of such services is either measured with different user-centered studies (like usability tests or laboratory experiments) or, in the context of IR, with their contribution to measures like precision and recall. However, each evaluation methodology has its certain disadvantages. For example, user-centered experiments are often costly and small-scaled; IR experiments rely on relevance assessments and measure only relevance of documents. In this work we operationalize the usefulness model of Cole et al. (2009) on the level of system support to measure not only the local effect of an IR service, but the impact it has on the whole search process. We therefore use a log-based evaluation approach which models user interactions within sessions with positive signals and apply it for the case of a search term suggestion service. We found that the usage of the service significantly often implicates the occurrence of positive signals during the following session steps.

This might be a result of a deadline, the system's performance or some other event. In this paper, we report results of a study with forty-five participants which investigated how time constraints and system delays impacted the user experience during information search. We randomly assigned half of our study participants to a treatment condition where they were only allowed five minutes per search task (the other half were given no time limits). For half of participants' search tasks, five second delays were introduced after queries were submitted and SERP results were clicked. We used multilevel modeling to evaluate a number of hypotheses about the effects of time constraint, system delays and user experience. We found those in the time constraint condition reported significantly greater time pressure, experienced higher task difficulty, less satisfaction with their performance, increased importance of working fast and engaged in more metacognitive monitoring. We found when experiencing system delays participants reported slower system speeds when encountering delays on the second task. This work opens a new line of inquiry into how time pressure impacts the search experience and how tools and interfaces might be designed to support people who are searching under time pressure. It also presents an example of how multilevel modeling can be used to better understand and model the complex interactions that occur during interactive information retrieval.

Entity cards are intended to enhance search experience in several ways: (i) they help searchers navigate diversified results, (ii) provide a summary of relevant content directly on the results page and (iii) support exploratory search by highlighting relevant entities associated with a given user query. We conducted a large-scale crowd-sourced user study, with more than $700$ unique searchers, to investigate the effects of entity cards on search behaviour and perceived workload. We find that the presence of ECs has a strong effect on both the way users interact with search results and their perceived task workload. Furthermore, by manipulating EC properties content, coherence and vertical diversity), we uncover different effects and interactions between card properties on measures of search behaviour and workload. Our study contributes an in-depth analysis of the effects of entity cards on user interaction with modern Web search interfaces.

They introduce a significant change in information access, not only by introducing voice control and touch gestures but also by enabling dialogues where the context is preserved. This raises the need for evaluation of their effectiveness in assisting users with their tasks. However, in order to understand which type of user interactions reflect different degrees of user satisfaction we need explicit judgements. In this paper, we describe a user study that was designed to measure user satisfaction over a range of typical scenarios of use: controlling a device, web search, and structured search dialogue. Using this data, we study how user satisfaction varied with different usage scenarios and what signals can be used for modeling satisfaction in the different scenarios. We find that the notion of satisfaction varies across different scenarios, and show that, in some scenarios (e.g. making a phone call), task completion is very important while for others (e.g. planning a night out), the amount of effort spent is key. We also study how the nature and complexity of the task at hand affects user satisfaction, and find that preserving the conversation context is essential and that overall task-level satisfaction cannot be reduced to query-level satisfaction alone. Finally, we shed light on the relative effectiveness and usefulness of voice-controlled intelligent agents, explaining their increasing popularity and uptake relative to the traditional query-response interaction.

We study three types of word changes: whether to remove or retain a word in the current query; whether or not to add a brand-new word to the query; whether or not to reuse a word (included in previous queries, but removed in the current query). Three types of factors are examined: session-level factors measuring task and user characteristics; query-level factors related to past user activities in a session; word-level factors for the characteristics of the examined word and its relation to the current query and search results. Statistical analysis suggests that: word-level factors strongly influence all three types of word changes; query-level factors only show a clear influence on retaining or removing a word; task-level factors exhibit limited direct influence on all three types of word changes. Analysis also disclose reasons for different word changes: users remove a word to stop exploring a subtask, or to correct bad performing queries; they look for related, unused words from recently viewed result summaries and add to queries; reusing a word usually indicates reverting from a subtask to the main task or another subtask.

This study describes the use of QAC by 29 searchers working on eight assigned search topics in a lab setting. We found that our subjects had differing propensities to use QAC, with some searchers rarely using it, while others used QACs for about half their queries. This study extends prior work by examining the use of QAC in the context of whole search sessions across multiple topics, and by comparing search behavior and visual attention for queries that used QAC and those that did not. The study concludes with an exploration of differences in QAC usage and query behavior among searchers, which reveals six possible query entry profiles.

Seven of these are derived from a psychological conception of what experiencing and experiences are. Three supplementary dimensions spring from the observation that experiences apparently have become especially valuable phenomena in Western societies. The 10 dimensions are tried out in a field study at the Center for Art and Media (ZKM) in Germany with the purpose to study their applicability in the evaluation of interactive sound archives. 29 walk-alongs were carried out with 58 museums visitors. Our analysis showed that it was possible to identify the 10 experience dimensions in the study material. Some dimensions were expressed more frequently than others. The distribution of expressed dimensions and the content of the user comments provided a clear picture of how the two sound archives differed in respect to the experiential qualities.

Employing the User Engagement Scale (UES), we found evidence of a relationship between students' comprehension of the texts and their degree of engagement with them. However, this association was confined to one of the UES subscales and was not consistent across levels of engagement. An examination of additional variables found little evidence that system and content characteristics influenced engagement; however, we noted that all students' reported increased knowledge, but topical interest for non-engaged students declined. Results contribute to existing literature by adding further evidence that the relationship between engagement and comprehension is complex and mediated.

As it is intended to be a position paper and not a systematic survey, a comprehensive review of literature is not presented here. However, the authors draw on some early stage research, in this emerging area, to describe and explain the generation of neuro-physiological evidence using three types of modalities. The modalities and the associated methods described here, presented in order of increasing complexity, include Eye-tracking, EEG, and fMRI. The paper concludes with a few critical observations regarding the promises and perils of using neuro-physiological approaches in studying search and search behavior.

As inadvertent disclosure of privileged content can adversely impact a client's interests, review for privilege is a high-stakes process that is most often performed manually. Because the circumstances in which privilege can be claimed are generally well defined, review for privilege is amenable to some degree of automation. This paper describes the design of an interactive system to support privilege review in which the goals are to improve the speed and accuracy of privilege review. Results are reported for a within-subjects study in which six reviewers with different levels of expertise examined email for attorney-client privilege or any other valid basis for withholding the content from release. Quantitative results indicate that substantial and statistically significant improvements in recall can be achieved, but no significant differences in average review speed were detected. Participants self-reported that the identity features exposed by the system were most useful to them, and that the present implementation of features based on content or date added no discernible additional value.

Automatically sharing traces of information about web activity could substantially improve these collaborative information tasks, but conventional wisdom suggests that people are very reluctant to share information about web usage. Because work settings have different rules and practices about privacy, we carried out the first systematic study of people's privacy concerns about sharing web activity within workgroups. To provide a better understanding of privacy concerns about sharing web activity at work, we conducted a two-week diary study with 18 participants. Our study system asked participants to report on their search tasks and privacy concerns. Surprisingly, our results showed that people have little concern about sharing the majority of their activities with their work colleagues, and had even fewer concerns with sharing work-related activities. Our results provide new insights into the possibilities of sharing web activities within workgroups, and provide evidence that tools based on automatic sharing of awareness information can be feasible.

The presence of both search and collaboration behaviors makes CIR a complex search format, which further drives a critical need to understand CIR's search context. The contextual support for CIR should consider search contexts derived from both team members' search histories (including users' own search histories and partners' search histories) and their explicit collaboration (e.g., chatting). As it stands, existing studies on contextual search support only focus on Individual Information Retrieval (IIR) and only utilize individuals' own search histories. In this paper, we examine the unique search contexts (e.g., partners' search histories and team collaboration histories) in CIR. Based on a user study data collection with 54 participants, we find that compared to the use of individuals' own search histories, CIR contextual support is more effective when utilizing partners' search histories and teams' collaboration behaviors. More interestingly, though the explicit communication information (i.e., chat content) often involves massive noisy information, involving such noise does not affect the ranking of relevant documents since it also does not appear in relevant documents.

A task contains an evolving collection of documents to which the user is referring and that are relevant to the task. In the case of Web documents people tend to rely on their organisational skills and use a variety of ""keeping"" and ""re-finding"" tools which traditionally include bookmarks, history and search, amongst others. This paper reports the results of surveys conducted to investigate the way that people keep and re-find Web based tasks. As tasks can be interrupted or conducted over different sessions a user needs to keep, re-find, and resume them. A prototype called PiMxT is also presented, which uses an incremental density-based clustering approach to automatically generate and keep task-clusters by considering the user's window and tab switching, and re-visitation behaviour. The algorithm attempts to identify those documents that pertain to the same task-cluster, and also when a switch between two documents is effectively a task-switch. PiMxT allows for searching and filtering across the task-clusters as well as task-resumption through different visualisations. This tool was evaluated through a usability study and a questionnaire, and it was found that the time taken by the 15 participants to re-find and resume tasks was on average 44% less in 77% of the cases. Furthermore, although the participants expected PiMxT to be more complete and accurate they all recognised its usefulness.

In this work, we propose an approach to reduce information overload in navigation by automatically focusing on important documents, adaptively to the tasks at hand. Based on the idea of managed forgetting, we present a ranking method, which unifies activity logs and semantic information about documents into a common framework to identify important documents to the user's current tasks. Our experiments on two real-world datasets, both collected from knowledge work activities in professional scenarios, show that our ranking approach outperforms the baseline methods for both subsequent access prediction and the effectiveness in ranking important documents. Furthermore, we implemented and demonstrated a system for decluttering information spaces as a proof of concept of our managed forgetting approach.

Current search systems usually do not provide support for these stages, but provide a static set of features predominantly focused on supporting micro-level search interactions. This paper investigates the utility of search user interface (SUI) features at different macro-level stages of complex tasks. A user study was designed, using simulated work tasks, to explicitly place users within different stages of a complex task: pre-focus, focus, and post-focus. Active use, passive use and perceived usefulness of features were analysed in order to derive when search features are most useful. Our results identify significant differences in the utility of SUI features between each stage. Specifically, we have observed that informational features are naturally useful in every stage, while input and control features decline in usefulness after the pre-focus stage, and personalisable features become more useful after the pre-focus stage. From these findings, we conclude that features less commonly found in web search interfaces can provide value for users, without cluttering simple searches, when provided at the right times.

Using search engine optimization (SEO), content producers seek to increase the visibility of their content. SEO is more likely to be practiced by commercially motivated content producers such as pharmaceutical companies than by non-commercial providers such as governmental bodies. In this study, we ask whether content quality correlates with the presence or absence of SEO measures on a web page. We conducted a user study in which N = 61 participants comprising laypeople as well as experts in health information assessment evaluated health-related web pages classified as either optimized or non-optimized. The subjects rated the expertise of non-optimized web pages as higher than the expertise of optimized pages, justifying their appraisal by the more competent and reputable appearance of non-optimized pages. In addition, comments about the website operators of the non-optimized pages were exclusively positive, while optimized pages tended to receive positive as well as negative assessments. We found no differences between the ratings of laypeople and experts. Since non-optimized, but high-quality content may be outranked by optimized content of lower quality, trusted sources should be prioritized in rankings.

They can be used to, e.g., estimate the relevance of read documents and expand search queries using machine learning. In this paper, we present the Reading Model Assessment tool (ReMA), an interactive tool for assessing gaze-based relevance estimation models. Our tool allows experimenters to easily browse recorded trials, compare the model output to a ground truth, and visualize gaze-based features at the token- and paragraph-level that serve as model input. Our goal is to facilitate the understanding of the relation between eye movements and the human relevance estimation process, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a model at hand, and, eventually, to enable researchers to build more effective models.

However, an understanding of how ovarian cancer (OC) patients and survivors access genetic testing (GT)-related information is limited, especially how they search online for such information. We interviewed 21 OC patients and survivors about their GT experience and GT-related information search experience. Of the 21 participants, ten (47.6%) conducted online searches. These participants chose sources based on particular evaluative criteria and displayed specific intentions in searching in the first instance. Participants were concerned about online information quality and were frustrated with information understandability and a lack of OC-specific GT information. Future studies with representative samples are needed to understand ovarian cancer patients’ genetic information search behavior to inform the design of search systems and information sources that can effectively address their unmet information needs.

Data storytelling is an emerging visualization paradigm that aims to “tell a story” with data in order to elicit deeper reflections in an effective manner. However, the effects of adding a narrative to a visualization on the memorability of the information remain speculative. Based on a review of related work, we synthesize a framework of data storytelling principles with concrete actions for every principle. We use this framework to design an online, controlled experiment to test compare traditional data visualizations with data storytelling visualizations in terms of their effects on short-term and long-term recall of information displayed in the visualizations. In general, despite long-held assumptions in the visualization community, we find no significant differences in recall between traditional visualizations and data storytelling visualization. However, we find indications that the cognitive load induced by different chart types and self-assessed prior knowledge on the chart topics could possibly have a moderating effect on information recall.

Information search outcome was measured by knowledge gained and the change in confidence level. We developed two hypotheses suggesting that high perceived eHealth literacy participants will gain more knowledge and become more confident in their post-search answers. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. 17 participants each from high and low perceived eHealth literacy groups used Google search engine to search for three topics, each with three factual questions. The results showed that both perceived eHealth literacy groups were able to find the correct answers, but only high perceived eHealth literacy participants were more confident in their search outcome. The finding corroborates the positive relationship between efficacy and outcome expectations in self-efficacy theory.

To learn about how users judge the credibility of such results and how they influence search outcomes, a controlled web-based user study (N = 96) was conducted. Using resources made available by scholars in the community, we study featured snippets in a medical context with participants being tasked with determining whether a named treatment is helpful for a specified medical condition both before and after viewing the search results. Experimental conditions varied the presence and credibility of featured snippets. Our findings indicate that participants tend to overestimate the credibility of information in featured snippets. Featured snippets are, moreover, shown to often change users’ opinion about a topic, especially if they are uncertain. Showing correct information inside featured snippets helped participants make more accurate decisions, whereas incorrect or contradicting information led to more harmful outcomes.

For e-commerce search systems, understanding natural language coming through voice assistants, chatbots or from conversational search is an essential ability to understand what the user really wants. However, evaluation datasets with natural and detailed information needs of product-seekers which could be used for research do not exist. Due to privacy issues and competitive consequences, only few datasets with real user search queries from logs are openly available. In this paper, we present a dataset of 3,540 natural language queries in two domains that describe what users want when searching for a laptop or a jacket of their choice. The dataset contains annotations of vague terms and key facts of 1,754 laptop queries. This dataset opens up a range of research opportunities in the fields of natural language processing and (interactive) information retrieval for product search.

In exploratory search, however, users may lack the necessary domain knowledge to assess the relevance of query suggestions with respect to their information needs. In this article, we investigate the use of alternative queries in exploratory search. Alternative queries are queries that would retrieve similar search results to those currently visible on-screen. They are independent of the original search query and can, therefore, be updated dynamically as users scroll through search results. In addition to being follow-on queries, alternative queries serve as keyword summaries of the current search results page to help users assess whether results are inline with their search intents. We investigated the use of alternative queries in scientific literature search and their impact on user behavior and perception. In a user study, participants inspected half as many documents per query when alternative queries were present, but were exposed to over 40% more search results overall. Despite using them extensively as follow-on queries, user feedback focused on the summarization properties offered by alternative queries; finding it reassuring that documents were relevant to their search goals.

In this paper, we further propose that a stance of ability based design and participatory design approaches can further involve, engage and support people with intellectual disability in interactive information retrieval (IIR) research. Through a case study with an accessible prototype designed to access instructional videos, we demonstrate how an approach building on participant's interests and providing them support as part of the study design leads to ecologically valid observations. The accessible prototype makes use of images as prompts and query support, and includes social aspects. Our observations confirm that users with intellectual disability favour a visual approach to information access and interaction. The contributions of this work are primarily 1) a 2 step approach with supported participatory design approaches involving early prototypes 2) a case study of this approach to investigate information access interfaces with people with intellectual disability and 3) a reflection on the case study and applicability of the method in IIR evaluation.

This paper provides a preliminary analysis of a subset of data from a larger study and compares the learning outcomes of 10 domain experts and 10 non-experts. Participants completed three search tasks designed to elicit different cognitive processes and behaviors; learning outcomes were explored with pre- and post-session written summaries and pre- and post-task questions. We used existing metrics to examine the learning breadth and depth of the written summaries. General searchers wrote longer summaries than domain experts, but there were no significant differences in the learning outcomes between the two groups.

The dataset comprises 849 manually categorized questions (557 in English, 292 in German) from 63 participants combined with a detailed interaction log, which allows replaying each session (29 hours total). The presented dataset and analyses aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a starting point to develop in-depth studies and prototypical systems.

While a majority of these systems use binary tags, continuous item-tag relevance scores, such as those in tag genome, offer richer descriptions of item content. For example, tag genome for movies assigns the tag “gangster” to the movie “The Godfather (1972)” with a score of 0.93 on a scale of 0 to 1. Tag genome has received considerable attention in recommender systems research and has been used in a wide variety of studies, from investigating the effects of recommender systems on users to generating ideas for movies that appeal to certain user groups. In this paper, we present tag genome for books, a dataset containing book-tag relevance scores, where a significant number of tags overlap with those from tag genome for movies. To generate our dataset, we designed a survey based on popular books and tags from the Goodreads dataset. In our survey, we asked users to provide ratings for how well tags applied to books. We generated book-tag relevance scores based on user ratings along with features from the Goodreads dataset. In addition to being used to create book recommender systems, tag genome for books can be combined with the tag genome for movies to tackle cross-domain problems, such as recommending books based on movie preferences.

SAL research requires significant amounts of data that capture both search behavior of users and their acquired knowledge in order to obtain conclusive insights or train supervised machine learning models. However, the creation of such datasets is costly and requires interdisciplinary efforts in order to design studies and capture a wide range of features. In this paper, we address this issue and introduce an extensive dataset based on a user study, in which 114 participants were asked to learn about the formation of lightning and thunder. Participants’ knowledge states were measured before and after Web search through multiple-choice questionnaires and essay-based free recall tasks. To enable future research in SAL-related tasks we recorded a plethora of features and person-related attributes. Besides the screen recordings, visited Web pages, and detailed browsing histories, a large number of behavioral features and resource features were monitored. We underline the usefulness of the dataset by describing three, already published, use cases.

However, since the multi-modal lifelog data contains objective context information and subjective user labeling, it is challenging to record the lifelog thoroughly and perform personalized recommendations in real-time. In this work, we design a mobile application (App), LifeRec, to record multi-modal lifelog data and perform personalized recommendations by communicating with the remote server. The App helps users collect various lifelog information (e.g., location, diet, activity, and mood) and receive real-time recommendation with privacy protection and little effort. It is useful for lifelog data collection, user status monitoring, and various ubiquitous recommendation tasks. We examine LifeRec in a one-week field study with seven subjects. The users’ experience feedback and recording results show great usability and task completeness with our App.

These users provide a total of more than two billion individual listening events that span a time range of over 15 years, from February 2005 until March 2020. These listening events refer to a total of 50 million distinct tracks of 5 million distinct artists. Beside the common metadata (i. e., artist and track name), LFM-2b contains additional information both regarding the users and items. This includes the demographic information of users, namely country, gender, and age, and the fine-grained genre and style of items together with the vector embeddings of their lyrics. LFM-2b is a rich dataset that enables research on a variety of recommender system algorithms, such as the ones based on collaborative filtering (e.g., leveraging the user–item interactions in the form of listening events), but also content-based approaches (e.g., exploiting genres and lyrics), or hybrid combinations thereof. Users’ demographic information furthermore enable experimentation on identifying and mitigating various data and algorithmic biases of recommender systems, and investigating fairness aspects of such systems, e.g., according to gender.

Sometimes cross-session searches may be unanticipated, however, in many cases users know beforehand that their search will spread across multiple sessions. Little is known about why people expect to search across multiple sessions. Based on a qualitative analysis of the interview data collected from a diary study, we identified two types of reasons that motivate people to conduct cross-session searches: (1) task-oriented motivations, (2) cognition-oriented motivations. We also identified a group of reasons that cause challenges for cross-session search. Our findings have implications for the future design of search systems to support cross-session search from different aspects.

Information searching is an integral part of the creative thinking process. The purpose of this study is to discover the creative thinking processes and search strategies students use to generate new ideas in academic and everyday life information use contexts. The data were collected through a pre-task interview, a search session for a creative task, and a post-task interview. Fifteen graduate students at a research university participated in the study. From the data analysis, we identified four distinctive, yet interconnected creative thinking processes: planning for creative search tasks, searching for new ideas, synthesizing search results, and organizing ideas. Based on these findings, we point out the need to design search systems to support creative thinking processes during searching to facilitate generation of new ideas.

A within-subject experiment was conducted, where participants used an interactive and a non-interactive version of a mock AI fact-checking system, and rated their perceived correctness of COVID-19 related claims. We collected web-page interactions, eye-tracking data, and mental workload using NASA-TLX. We found that the presence of the affordance of interactively manipulating the AI system's prediction parameters affected users’ dwell times, and eye-fixations on AOIs, but not mental workload. In the interactive system, participants spent the most time evaluating claims’ correctness, followed by reading news. This promising result shows a positive role of interactivity in a mixed-initiative AI-powered system.

We do so by examining whether Search Engine Result Pages (SERP) enhanced with emojis, unlike standard SERP, affect children’s search behaviour. To capture search behaviour, we use well-known metrics, in addition to users’ success in identifying relevant results on SERP. Outcomes from our work reveal that a one-size-fits-all approach for SERP does not befit students who are searching for learning. Thus, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for future research, focused on the design and evaluation of information retrieval systems that can better support the classroom setting.

Unlike web product search, where users have access to diverse information as to why the products might be suitable for their needs, in the voice product search domain the amount of information that can be disclosed is inherently limited. Users in general evaluate a maximum of two products and usually buy low consideration products when using the voice channel [3]. In order to enable decision making in voice product searches we propose here a framework for generating pointwise and pairwise review-based explanations that disclose further information about the products. The POINTWISE method selects a helpful sentence from the top review of the recommended product based on a BERT-based model and uses the extracted sentence to fill a response template. The PAIRWISE method first selects a diverse pair of products—in terms of their review-based representations—from the top-k ranked products for a query, then chooses a helpful review sentence for each product in the pair, and finally fills a template with the sentences. Besides further describing the product, the PAIRWISE method gives a reference point to the users and enables a comparison of the recommendations based on two diverse products for the same information need. Our crowd-sourced evaluation of explanations based on queries from a widely used e-commerce platform shows that the proposed pairwise explanations provide statistically significant improvements compared to the POINTWISE and BASELINE methods for two goals: Effectiveness, i.e. helping users to make good decisions, and Transparency, i.e. explaining how the system works. The gains of PAIRWISE over POINTWISE and BASELINE are consistent for different subsets of data based on the diversity of the selected pairs, average product price associated with the query and the query ambiguity.

The aim of the present paper was to identify gaps and gap-bridging techniques in situated tourism CIS and technology use across the travel stages of trip planning and during the trip. Interview and diary data were collected from 20 free-trip groups of 63 Chinese tourists who traveled from mainland China to Australia during 2018-2019. We identified 8 types of gaps as well as 8 gap-bridging strategies. The results show that tourists demonstrated adaptive CIS behavior over the trip as they solved or compromised the gaps encountered. Suggestions on system design are also discussed to better support tourist information and collaborative practices.

However, in order to be effective in a conversational setting, the justifications have to be appropriate for the conversation so far. Previous approaches rely on a user history of reviews and ratings of related items to personalize the recommendation, but this information is not generally available when conversing with a new user, and as such a cold-start problem imposes a challenge in generating suitable justifications. To address this problem, we propose and validate a new method, CONJURE (CONversational JUstificatons for REcommendations) to generate contextually relevant justifications for conversational recommendations. Specifically, we investigate whether the conversation itself can be used effectively to model the user, identify relevant review content from other users, and generate a justification that boosts the user’s confidence in and understanding of the recommendation. To implement CONJURE, we test several novel extensions to prior algorithms, by exploiting an auxiliary corpus of movie reviews to construct the justifications from extracted pieces of those reviews. In particular, we explore different conversation representations and ranking approaches. To evaluate CONJURE, we developed a pairwise crowd task to compare justifications. Our results show large, significant improvements in Efficiency and Transparency metrics over the previous non-contextualized template-based methods. We plan to release our code and an augmented conversation corpus on Github.

However, there has been limited research on user engagement with immersive technologies in the medical library setting. In this exploratory study, we conducted interviews and on-site observations with 17 medical students who had experience with immersive technologies at the medical library. The affordance lens was used to explore how the relationship between immersive technologies and medical students enables and constrains their information practices. The preliminary results suggest that users’ perceived affordances of immersive technologies are not a solid outcome but a dynamic process. In our case, users’ perceptions of technology affordances can be categorized into perceived entertainment affordances, perceived learning affordances, perceived instrumental affordances, and perceived socializing affordances. We also identified three perceived constraints in medical students’ experiences with immersive technologies in the library setting. The study contributes to the literature on user engagement from an affordance perspective, and yield practical implications for medical training and education by leveraging the immersive technologies in the library context.

In this scenario, recommender systems are designed to guide listeners in finding tracks and artists that best fit their requests, having therefore the power to influence the diversity of the music they listen to. Albeit several works have proposed new techniques for developing diversity-aware recommendations, little is known about how people perceive diversity while interacting with music recommendations. In this study, we interview several listeners about the role that diversity plays in their listening experience, trying to get a better understanding of how they interact with music recommendations. We recruit the listeners among the participants of a previous quantitative study, where they were confronted with the notion of diversity when asked to identify, from a series of electronic music lists, the most diverse ones according to their beliefs. As a follow-up, in this qualitative study we carry out semi-structured interviews to understand how listeners may assess the diversity of a music list and to investigate their experiences with music recommendation diversity. We report here our main findings on 1) what can influence the diversity assessment of tracks and artists’ music lists, and 2) which factors can characterize listeners’ interaction with music recommendation diversity.

We used realism check questionnaire items found in the decision-making literature to assess the realism of the scenario and tasks (i.e., simulated work task scenarios) used as part of a broader study of decision-making. The realism check results indicated that participants could imagine themselves in the scenario (i.e., making recommendations for a friend) and could imagine making recommendations like the ones in the study. The findings suggest that realism check questions are a relatively low effort method to assess the realism of simulated work task scenarios used in an interactive information retrieval study. Future research is needed to understand the relationship between realism and other important factors in IIR studies (e.g., topic interest or prior knowledge, search behaviors).

This study presents preliminary findings of older adults' search behavior with a spoken conversational search agent which represents the next generation search paradigm. Our findings show that, compared with their younger counterparts, older adults' search conversations lasted longer and included more requests. Their requests had greater length and tended to have a lower proportion of unique words, more grammatically complex sentences and short pauses. In addition, the older subjects preferred to start a request with ""I"" and request questions with modal verbs were less frequent. They reformulated spoken requests as competently as did younger adults but elaborations on requests were uniquely founded among older adults. They also tended to have more than one query or question in a single request and rephrasing requests was more frequently observed than younger adults. System implications and future research directions are discussed.

A relatively “simple” solution then is result diversification to cover different interpretations, while in more “conversational” search interfaces, the user can be prompted to clarify their original request. We study clarification in the scenario of comparative questions that ask to compare several options. In our experiment that reflects a conversational search interface with a clarification component, 70% of the study participants find clarifications useful to retrieve relevant results for questions with unclear comparison aspects (e.g., “Which is better, Bali or Phuket?”) or without explicit comparison objects and aspects (e.g., “What is the best antibiotic?”).

Demonstrably false information propagates faster and more widely than truth and this has heralded a technological arms race. One possible mechanism for addressing misinformation is social: there is evidence seeing misinformation being challenged can ‘inoculate’ a reader against it. To date, no research has examined how discussions sparked by misinformation play out; What are the different ways in which people reply to posts containing misinformation? How does the discussion flow in each case? Are there differences between platforms? We address these questions through an inductive qualitative analysis of discussion threads on three public discussion platforms (Twitter, YouTube and two news sites) and on three topics (COVID, Brexit and climate change). We present a classification scheme of types of replies to misinformation, and show that replies show different patterns between platforms. Knowing how people reply to posts that contain misinformation enriches our knowledge of ‘human misinformation interaction,’ and provides an understanding of how socio-technical factors in platform design can reduce the risk of misinformation spreading.

Algorithms purportedly support this avoidance by creating filter bubbles filled only with agreeable information potentially increasing polarisation and undermining democracy. How accurate is this portrayal, though? Recent research has begun to cast doubt. We challenge these assumptions and report a two-phase analysis of filter bubble-bursting behavior. The first phase reports novel incidental findings from an interview study on the role of information interaction in view change. Participants demonstrated a clear interest in a diversity of information, including information specifically opposed to their own views. The second phase reports findings from a diary study specifically designed to investigate people's interactions with information that reflected a different view to theirs. We examine how people found disagreeable information, how they responded to it and the factors affecting their responses. We find that people will sometimes actively seek and engage with disagreeable information, rather than avoid and ignore it. Our findings pave the way for future information interfaces that support this previously undiscussed information interaction.

Situating Search	2022	long	221–232	completed; Vivien; design;type;theoretical; perspective paper; domain;domain-agnostic	Information Seeking Strategies; Language models; Search models	Search systems, like many other applications of machine learning, have become increasingly complex and opaque. The notions of relevance, usefulness, and trustworthiness with respect to information were already overloaded and often difficult to articulate, study, or implement. Newly surfaced proposals that aim to use large language models to generate relevant information for a user’s needs pose even greater threat to transparency, provenance, and user interactions in a search system. In this perspective paper we revisit the problem of search in the larger context of information seeking and argue that removing or reducing interactions in an effort to retrieve presumably more relevant information can be detrimental to many fundamental aspects of search, including information verification, information literacy, and serendipity. In addition to providing suggestions for counteracting some of the potential problems posed by such models, we present a vision for search systems that are intelligent and effective, while also providing greater transparency and accountability.

Consequently, search systems may consider adapting to a user's language proficiency when retrieving, composing, and presenting search results. In order to perform such adaptation, it is necessary to first get an estimate of a user's proficiency, ideally through simply observing their behaviors while searching. To this end, this paper investigates the extent to which a user's language proficiency can be inferred from their eye movements while they are evaluating search results. Classification results involving data from English-, Spanish-, and Chinese-speaking study participants show that such an inference is indeed possible, and with relatively high accuracies for all languages. It is also shown that feature sets involving statistics from an entire search result page, combined with gaze data from individual results, have the highest classification accuracies. Moreover, a user's Average Fixation Durations, Refixations, and Pupil Dilations are found to be the most significant features.

In response, the search-as-learning research community has undertaken a wide range of research questions focused on understanding how various types of learning outcomes are affected by searcher characteristics, the search task, and the search system. Typically, these views embed learning within a search system. In this paper we take a different view, embedding search within a framework for an end-to-end learning system designed to support learning in a formal educational context. Our central goal is to motivate research questions aligned to advance progress on techniques for active support of comprehension and formal learning. Thus we intentionally set aside goals for informal and surface learning. We argue that to be effective, such a search-centric learning system must model four key components: individual students (searcher factors), the educational domain (topic factors), academic assignments (task factors), and progress toward learning goals (the objective function of the end-to-end system). In modeling these components, our hypothetical system makes inferences about students’ learning histories, knowledge states, comprehension, and the utilities of different types of information resources. We present examples of possible techniques and data sources for each model. We also introduce the novel concept of leveraging school assignments as rich task context. Our intention is not to propose a functional system, but to frame search-as-learning in the context of comprehension and to inspire research questions arising from an end-to-end view of this important research domain.

However, little prior information retrieval research has considered how people use search tools and information resources to support their creative stages. To gain a better understanding of how and why users interact with information resources and tools during a creative process, we conducted a two-week diary study with 11 participants. We recorded their information seeking behavior through a combination of diary entries, data logging, and reflective interviews. Our analysis identified five common reasons for how people use existing information resources (e.g., search engines, video sites, image sites, Q&A sites, and other social sites) to support their creative process. We also report on how different information resources were preferred for different purposes at different creative stages. For instance, participants often used images to help support ideation, Q&A sites to learn from other creators and to find tips and recommendations, and social media to select ideas and collect feedback on their creative projects. We also identified challenges participants faced when working on their creative projects. Our findings provide insights for the future design of search engines, improvement of search algorithms, and the development of novel tools to support users during different creative stages.

In this research, we investigate the information-seeking practices of intelligence analysts (IAs) employed by a U.S. government agency. Specifically, we focus on the needs, practices, and challenges related to IAs searching for procedural knowledge using an internal system called the Tradecraft Hub (TC Hub). The TC Hub is a searchable repository of procedural knowledge documents written by agency employees. Procedural knowledge (as opposed to factual and conceptual knowledge) includes knowledge about step-by-step procedures, techniques, methods, tools, technologies, and skills, and is inherently task-oriented. We report on a survey study involving 22 IAs who routinely use the TC Hub. Our survey was designed to address four research questions. In RQ1, we investigate the types of work-related objectives that motivate IAs to search the TC Hub. In RQ2, we investigate the types of information IAs seek when they search the TC Hub. In RQ3, we investigate important relevance criteria used by IAs when judging the usefulness of information. Finally, in RQ4, we investigate the challenges faced by IAs when searching the TC Hub. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for improving and extending searchable knowledge base systems such as the TC Hub that exist in many organizations.

Previous qualitative research suggests that people use two types of search affordances to find the data they need: they either go to a data portal that probably contains the data and search there; or they start on a regular web search engine, which sometimes returns results that are datasets. For the first type of search, prior works have analysed logs from different data portals to understand basic tenets of search behaviour such as query length or topics. In this paper, we advance the state of the art in dataset search behaviour with a comprehensive transaction log analysis study (n = 236441 sessions) of an international open data portal, in which we compare sessions straight on a data portal (internal searches) against sessions that land on a dataset or SERP (search engine result page) through a referral from a web search engine (external). Using dataset downloads as a proxy for successful searches, we find a statistically significant, though weak relationship between the use of keyword search and session type and between the use of search facets and session type (moderate). We also discover and discuss behavioural patterns and user profiles across session types.

While many definitions for Exploratory Search have been proposed, the main dimensions involve high uncertainty with respect to the problem context, the user expertise, and the search process. In this paper, we draw together the different characteristics relating to the three main exploratory dimensions to provide a conceptual model of exploratory search. We build an exploratory search questionnaire using this model. We then use the questionnaire instrument to examine how literature searches are exploratory and what factors influence the exploratory dimensions and characteristics. We provide one of the first detailed investigations into the nature of exploratory literature review searches. Our analysis of the 368 responses reveals that about 84% of the participants described their literature review task as somewhat exploratory or very exploratory in nature. Also, the analysis points to another dimension of the exploratory search, the knowledge gain/change dimension. Furthermore, we investigated how users’ experience influences how people rate the exploratory search characteristics (e.g., whether they find surprising information, learn new concepts and keywords).

This simple taxonomy, however, greatly reduces the latent richness of viewpoints and thereby limits the potential of research and practical applications in this field. Work in the communication sciences has already demonstrated that viewpoints can be represented in much more comprehensive ways, which could enable a deeper understanding of users’ interactions with debated topics online. For instance, a viewpoint’s stance usually has a degree of strength (e.g., mild or strong), and, even if two viewpoints support or oppose something to the same degree, they may use different logics of evaluation (i.e., underlying reasons). In this paper, we draw from communication science practice to propose a novel, two-dimensional way of representing viewpoints that incorporates a viewpoint’s stance degree as well as its logic of evaluation. We show in a case study of tweets on debated topics how our proposed viewpoint label can be obtained via crowdsourcing with acceptable reliability. By analyzing the resulting data set and conducting a user study, we further show that the two-dimensional viewpoint representation we propose allows for more meaningful analyses and diversification interventions compared to current approaches. Finally, we discuss what this novel viewpoint label implies for HII research and how obtaining it may be made cheaper in the future.

However, users avoid engaging with them, because of their length and abstract legal language, which makes them hard to read and understand. We propose to support the understanding of PPs by using modular icons. Icons have already proven to be helpful in visualizing concepts with high information density. However, the value of using icons to supplement PPs lacks a scientific foundation. Thus, we conducted two studies to evaluate existing icon sets for their understandability and to teach participants their meaning in situ. We show that modular privacy icons can be taught using our process, which has the potential to aid quicker and easier comprehension of PPs. We contribute a set of tested modular privacy icons and a verified process on how to teach them to users incidentally during web browsing.

This paper describes a novel user interface tool, the Content Flow Bar, designed to allow users to quickly identify relevant fragments within informational videos to facilitate browsing, through a cognitively augmented form of navigation. It achieves this by providing semantic “snippets” that enable the user to rapidly scan through video content. The tool provides visually-appealing pop-ups that appear in a time series bar at the bottom of each video, allowing to see in advance and at a glance how topics evolve in the content. We conducted a user study to evaluate how the tool changes the users search experience in video retrieval, as well as how it supports exploration and information seeking. The user questionnaire revealed that participants found the Content Flow Bar helpful and enjoyable for finding relevant information in videos. The interaction logs of the user study, where participants interacted with the tool for completing two informational tasks, showed that it holds promise for enhancing discoverability of content both across and within videos. This discovered potential could leverage a new generation of navigation tools in search and information retrieval.

In this paper, we examine the relationships among user perception, gaze and search behaviour and user search performance. An eye-tracking study of biomedical domain experts’ interactions with novel search interfaces was conducted. A total of thirty-two users participated and searched for documents answering eight complex exploratory search tasks, using four different search interfaces. The findings suggest that gaze behaviour in terms of fixation durations based measures of areas of interest (AOI), i.e., visual attention to the elements of title, author, abstract and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms in document surrogates is correlated with search performance. Users are more likely to achieve better search performance by precision-based measures when 1) search tasks are perceived as difficult; 2) users attend to the element of abstract; and 3) users can recall using the per-query suggestions during the search processes. More importantly, our findings suggest that a user search interface design that displays contextual information between the suggested keywords and the document may better support users reformulating their queries for complex search tasks in the biomedical domain. We discuss implications for the design of search user interfaces for biomedical searching.

However, due to the large volume of born-digital documents that need to be reviewed, there is a growing need for technologies to assist human reviewers and improve the efficiency of the review process. For example, in sensitivity review, a reviewer needs to be able to quickly find documents that belong to specific latent semantic categories (e.g., documents about criminality that contain the personal details of victims). However, manually identifying such document categories is a challenging task when reviewing digital documents, due to the size of, and lack of structure in the collections. We hypothesise that reviewing documents that are clustered by their latent semantic categories will increase the efficiency of the human reviewers, since the reviewers will be able to review related documents in sequence. In this work, we conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of different clustering techniques, document metadata and automatic sensitivity classification, for grouping and prioritising documents for review, to increase the efficiency of the review process. Our study shows that reviewing documents in semantic clusters can significantly improve the efficiency (i.e., speed) of the sensitivity reviewers (+15.65%, T-Test, p<0.05) while maintaining the reviewers’ accuracy. Moreover, we propose a novel strategy for prioritising document clusters for review to maximise the number of documents that are opened to the public within a fixed reviewing time budget. Our proposed prioritisation strategy results in a significant increase in the number of documents that are opened to the public (+37.99%, T-Test, p<0.05) compared to prioritising documents without clusters.

Despite information seeking being an important aspect of collaboration, the information seeking behaviour of older adults and in particular couples remains under investigated. To address this gap, in this paper we present a qualitative investigation of older adults’ collaborative information seeking. Through in-depth interviews and demonstrations of real-life search tasks with eleven older couples, we show that older couples frequently engage in collaborative information seeking in daily tasks, interests, and to satisfy curiosity. Our research suggests that collaborative information seeking is a relationship maintenance behaviour among older couples, and that their long-term relationships may play a key role in how they communicate, make decisions, and develop divide and conquer strategies by taking on various roles during their collaborative information seeking. We also found that older couples construct shared views toward technology adoption and usage despite their individual differences. We include some reflections on the existing collaborative information systems and how they may adapt to fit older couples’ collaborative information seeking.

However, unlike in traditional stores, users of online shops need to find the right product on their own without support from expert salespersons. Conversational search could provide a means to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional product search engines. To establish design guidelines for such virtual product search assistants, we studied conversations in a user study (N = 24) where experts supported users in finding the right product for their needs. We annotated the conversations concerning their content and conversational structure and identified recurring conversational strategies. Our findings show that experts actively elicit the users’ information needs using funneling techniques. They also use dialogue-structuring elements and frequently confirm having understood what the client was saying by using discourse markers, e.g., “mhm”. With this work, we contribute insights and design implications for conversational product search assistants.

Crowdsourced labels are relatively cheap, and hence very popular, but are prone to disagreements, spam, and various biases which appear to be unexplained “noise” or “error”. In this paper, we provide examples of problems we have encountered running crowd labelling at large scale and around the globe, for search evaluation in particular. We demonstrate effects due to the time of day and day of week that a label is given; fatigue; anchoring; exposure; left-side bias; task switching; and simple disagreement between judges. Rather than simple “error”, these effects are consistent with well-known physiological and cognitive factors. “The crowd” is not some abstract machinery, but is made of people. Human factors that affect people’s judgement behaviour must be considered when designing research evaluations and in interpreting evaluation metrics.

While prior work has heavily explored the factors affecting people’s willingness to adopt contact-tracing solutions, which inform people when they have been exposed to someone positive for COVID-19, numerous countries have implemented other information-tracking solutions that use more data and more sensitive data than these commonly studied contact-tracing apps. In this work, we build on existing work focused on contact-tracing apps to explore adoption and design considerations for six representative information-tracking solutions for COVID-19, which differ in their goals and in the types of information they collect. To do so, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 44 participants to investigate the factors that influence their willingness to adopt these solutions. We find four main categories of influences on participants’ willingness to adopt such solutions: individual benefits of the solution, societal benefits of the solution, functionality concern, and digital safety (e.g., security and privacy) concerns. Further, we enumerate the factors that inform participants’ evaluations of these categories. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for the future design of information-tracking solutions and discuss how different factors may balance against benefits in future crisis situations.
F4EKK8DX	10.1145/3498366.3505770	Abualsaud, Mustafa; Smucker, Mark	The Dark Side of Relevance: The Effect of Non-Relevant Results on Search Behavior	2022	long	1–11	completed; design;method;questionnaire; data;re-use; design;type;explanatory; toine; design;method;user study; domain;WWW; infrastructure	user study; user behavior; Non-relevant documents	Understanding and modelling user behavior with search results is important to both search engine designers and the design of effectiveness measures. It is well established that users are less likely to view lower ranked search results, and recent research has shown that the type of relevant documents can influence when people stop examining results. However, while existing measures and research consider that relevant documents vary in utility and make use of relevance grades or preference judgments, non-relevant documents are largely all treated the same. In this paper, we show that the nature of non-relevant material affects users’ willingness to further explore a ranked list of search results. We first broaden our notion of non-relevant documents and define a spectrum of possible search engine result pages (SERPs). At one end of the spectrum, the search results were filled with off-topic non-relevant documents, and at the other end, the non-relevant documents were all on-topic, but failed to match the required sub-topic of the search task. We conducted a user study where participants used a mobile search interface to find answers to questions, and collected participants’ behavior while interacting with different SERPs on our spectrum. Our results show that user examination of search results, and time to query abandonment, is influenced by the coherence and type of non-relevant documents included in the SERP. When the SERP is coherent on an egregious topic, users spend the least amount of time before abandoning and are less likely to request to view more results. The time they spend increases as the SERP quality improves, and users are more likely to request to view more results when the SERP contains diversified non-relevant results on multiple subtopics. Our research implies that to improve information retrieval evaluation, we should be assessing the degree of non-relevance in search results as well as the degree of relevance.

One of the key challenges in cross-session search is resuming the previously started search task. If task resumption can be supported well in a mobile environment, we may be able to encourage academic searchers to make use of the small down-times they encounter while away from their computers (e.g., while in line at the market). If it is supported well in a desktop/laptop environment, the work that was done on a mobile device can easily be accessed and used. In this paper, we demonstrate an academic digital library search interface that supports cross-session cross-device search, using visualization approaches to support browsing and selection of past search topics, and faceted navigation features to support investigation and examination of previously saved documents.

Different users may have similar information needs, but use different query terms. The resulting user query variations can provide a wealth of useful information to IR researchers. Most recently, the keystroke-level telemetry data gathered as part of the CC-News-En collection provides important insights into how users create queries for a search task, at a level of detail not possible using a normal query log. In this demo, we present an interactive tool that enables practitioners to visualize users formulating queries. Our new tool is a temporal simulation of the typing behavior of crowdworkers, grouped by information need. It provides the ability to directly compare the cognitive behavior of multiple users simultaneously, and observe how query keyword selection and ordering happens before a final query is submitted to a search engine. To demonstrate the benefit of our tool, we include a qualitative study of four different user behavior patterns which were observed in the CC-News-En collection.

People need web search to gather information about a problem area, but this can also influence the rest of the creative process. To understand how web search affects early-stage design, we collected and analyzed search log and self-report data from 34 students in a project-based design class. Participants reported struggling with scoping broad, ill-defined information goals into queries, learning domain-specific language, and assessing the usefulness of information. Analysis found that more active and diverse search behavior (i.e. issuing more frequent and diverse queries, and opening more webpages) related to more progress in early-stage design (i.e. gathering more facts, articulating more insights, and developing better problem frames). Based on these findings, we discuss implications for designing search tools to support peoples' creative processes.

Often this task is not clearly expressed by the information seeker, nor directly supported by the search system. People also list their tasks using tools such as to-do applications, and while many of these could be search tasks, there is a lack of that recognition or a possible bridge to a search system. In the work reported here, we aim to create that bridge by analyzing data on both sides. In task management, we examined 1,000 to-do tasks annotated by human assessors for their appropriateness for a search engine and created a simple process to learn that classification. In search, we analyzed millions of queries in a search engine log to understand how often queries represent tasks that people express in to-do lists. Our results show that (1) we can accurately predict which of the to-do tasks are appropriate as search queries; and (2) such tasks do indeed show up in search engines as a substantial segment. Together, these findings outline an opportunity to link explicitly expressed tasks to search queries and vice versa. This has implications for both task completion and query understanding.

Using Anderson & Krathwohl's taxonomy of learning, we analyzed the complexity of real-life cross-session search tasks reported by 110 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. We found that cross-session search tasks often require different types of information (i.e., factual and conceptual information, procedure information, opinions, and information for helping metacognition) and are frequently associated with higher-level cognitive activities, including: applying analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our findings add knowledge about cross-session search, and have insights for future research related to system design and studying cross-session search.

Teachers in two European schools sharing the same language assigned their students (ages 10 and 11) an online information discovery exercise about a history topic covered in class. For this, children used a classic search interface and two novel ones enriched with emojis associated to relevant vs. irrelevant results. At the end of the exercise, children filled out a post-task questionnaire meant to elicit their perception on usability of the interfaces. Guided by four lenses, we analyse our findings and discuss whether (i) emoji-enriched interfaces lead to better performance for children using a search engine in the classroom and (ii) ""actions speak louder than words'' when looking at children's search experience. We learned various lessons from our examination of children's search behaviour that will guide the design of future interfaces, including the fact that emoji-enriched interfaces result in significant improvement in terms of children identifying relevant resources.

We demonstrate the visualization technique using eye-tracking data collected as part of a previously published search engine user study and show its value in communicating different patterns of searchers' gaze behavior under different user types and query types. We include a code sample in R to facilitate adoption of the method.

Drawing on the perspective of Relationship Motivation Theory (RMT), this study focused on the relatedness needs expressed by LGBTQ+ individuals that motivated them to seek and share information in online communities. Through a deductive thematic analysis of 156 posts to an LGBTQ+ online forum, our analysis reveals three main categories of relatedness needs: needs around being cared about, needs around caring for others and needs to build and maintain relationships. Implications for system design that better afford LGBTQ+ individuals? needs for relatedness are discussed.

A vast amount of information on the Internet is written text in the form of articles, and it is often said that summarising these texts could enhance their accessibility. This qualitative research investigates how people with ID prefer to gather information from articles, either in their original form or automatically summarised. The researchers observed the choices and strategies of 10 participants with ID through the reading process, and conducted contextual interviews to understand their preferences, attitudes and the difficulties they faced. The study found that the length of the article is only secondary to the relevance of the article to the person's interests. Summarised articles were found easier to read and having familiar words and images to supplement the text can help people with intellectual disability understand what an article is about.

To address this gap, we conduct a controlled study that aims to reveal how response latency affects mobile web search. Our preliminary results indicate that mobile web search users are four times more tolerant to response latency reported for desktop web search users. However, when exceeding a certain threshold of 7-10 sec, the delays have a sizeable impact and users report feeling significantly more tensed, tired, terrible, frustrated and sluggish, all which contribute to a worse subjective user experience.

Unfortunately, the interfaces employed by academic digital libraries provide little support for exploratory browsing, which is a critical first step in exploratory search. To address this shortcoming, we have designed and implemented a novel academic digital library interface (KLink Search) with two new features: visually linked keywords and an interactive workspace. Here, we present preliminary analysis of data collected in a controlled laboratory study (n=32) comparing KLink Search to a baseline interface. Participants reported higher degrees of usefulness, ease-of-use, satisfaction, and knowledge gain after using KLink Search. Participants spent more time on the search tasks, and were able to collect sets of documents that were highly relevant to the tasks. Results from this research illustrate the value of adding lightweight visual and interactive features to academic digital library search interfaces to support exploratory browsing.

Prior literature in intelligent systems suggests that by identifying speech acts in spoken dialogues, we can identify the search intent and the information needs of the user. Therefore, in this paper, we have used speech acts to address the problem of natural language understanding in conversational search systems. First, we collected human-system interaction data through a Wizard-of-Oz study. Next, we developed a gold-standard dataset where the human-system conversations are labeled with corresponding speech acts. Finally, we built the Multi-channel Deep Attention Network (MDAN) to identify the speech acts in information-seeking dialogues. The results highlight that the best performing model predicts speech acts with 90.2% accuracy. The MDAN architecture outperforms not only all traditional machine learning models but also the state-of-the-art single-channel BERT by 3.3 absolute points. We performed ablation analysis to show the impact of the three channels of MDAN individually and in combination. The results indicate that the best performance is achieved using all three channels for speech act prediction.

Since early information retrieval systems, users are trained to issue keyword searches and adapt to the language of the system. Recent research has shown that users often withhold detailed information about their initial information need, although they are able to express it in natural language. We therefore conduct a user study (N = 139) to investigate how four different design variants of search interfaces can encourage the user to reveal more information. Our results show that a chatbot-inspired search interface can increase the number of mentioned product attributes by 84% and promote natural language formulations by 139% in comparison to a standard search bar interface.

State-of-the-art approaches usually transform high-dimensional representations of documents into 2-dimensional vectors using dimensionality reduction algorithms. These vectors are then placed into a landscape hopefully retaining semantic information regarding similarity from the high-dimensional representation. Traditionally, dimensionality reduction algorithms are developed with static collections in mind. However, many ""real-world"" document collections, such as news articles, scientific literature, patents, Wikipedia, or tweets, to name a few, grow and evolve over time. Visualising the temporal change of these collections poses various challenges for out-of-the-box dimensionality reduction algorithms. In this paper, we propose strategies to adapt existing dimensionality reduction algorithms to incorporate change. These strategies ensure that landscapes at different intervals of the collection are robust with regard to spatio-temporal coherence. Furthermore, we propose metrics to measure the stability over time and compare several popular dimensionality reduction algorithms.

Besides serving diverse groups of users, recommenders need to represent and serve item providers fairly as well. In interviews with music artists, we identified that gender fairness is one of the artists' main concerns. They emphasized that female artists should be given more exposure in music recommendations. We analyze a widely-used collaborative filtering approach with two public datasets-enriched with gender information-to understand how this approach performs with respect to the artists' gender. To achieve gender balance, we propose a progressive re-ranking method that is based on the insights from the interviews. For the evaluation, we rely on a simulation of feedback loops and provide an in-depth analysis using state-of-the-art performance measures and metrics concerning gen-der fairness.

Among many cognitive factors associated with learning and searching, we consider interest development as an important dimension because it significantly affects users' learning performances but still remains understudied in interactive IR (IIR). To address this gap, our perspective paper proposes an interest-search-learning (ISL) model to reconceptualize learning in search and characterize the dynamic interplay of interest development, knowledge learning, and searching. Specifically, it achieves three interrelated goals: 1) characterizing the interactions between interest development, learning, and search behaviors; 2) synthesizing and proposing useful measures for capturing in-situ progresses and state variations in interest development and knowledge learning related to search behaviors; 3) identifying new research questions and directions linked to conceptualizing, building, and evaluating learning-centric IR systems. This paper uniquely integrates findings from three research communities (i.e. interest development, learning, IIR) into a cohesive framework and better structures our understanding of the multidimensional cognitive changes in search as learning (SAL). Including the exploration of interest development in SAL research will expand both conceptual and practical visions of AI-assisted learning.

This has been especially notable in long and complex learning endeavours. With web search engines nowadays used as the primary gateway for learners (or users) to find content that helps them realise their learning goals, they are often poorly equipped with the necessary tools to aid in sense-making, an important aspect of theSearch as Learning (SAL) process. Within theInformation Retrieval (IR) community, research efforts have explored ways to keep track of users' search context by providing a notepad-like interface for the collection of relevant articles, and aid them during the exploratory search process. However, these studies did not explicitly measure the effect that such tools have on knowledge and understanding during a complex, learning-oriented search task. In this paper, we address this research gap by carrying out an Interactive IR experiment with highlighting and note-taking tools built into the search interface. We conducted a crowdsourced between-subjects study (N=115), where participants were assigned to one of four conditions: (i) control (a standard web search interface); (ii) high (highlighting enabled);(iii) note (note-taking enabled); and (iv) highnote (both highlighting and note-taking enabled). We assess participants' learning with a recall-oriented vocabulary learning task, and a cognitively more taxing essay writing task. We find that(i) active reading tools do not aid in the vocabulary learning task. However,(ii) participants in high covered 34% more subtopics, and participants in note covered 34% more facts in their essays when compared to control. Furthermore, (iii) we observed that incorporating active learning tools significantly changed the search behaviour of participants across a number of measures. This is the first work that sheds light on the effect of active reading tools on the SAL process, with important design implications for learning-oriented search systems.

However, they provide less support for users completing complex search tasks. Complex search tasks involve a diverse set of cognitive and metacognitive activities, such as goal-setting, organizing information, drawing inferences, monitoring progress, and updating mental models. We report on a lab study (N=32) that investigated the uses and influences of a novel knowledge representation tool called the ""OrgBox'', developed to support searchers with complex tasks. The OrgBox was integrated into a custom-built search system and allowed participants to save information by drag-and-dropping textual passages into the tool, organize passages into ""boxes'', and make notes on passages and boxes. The OrgBox tool was compared to a baseline tool (the ""Bookmark'') that allowed participants to save passages, but not organize them nor make notes. We investigate four research questions. In RQ1, we investigate the effects of the knowledge representation tool on participants' post-task perceptions. In RQ2-RQ4, we investigate: (RQ2) how participants used different features of each tool; (RQ3) the perceived benefits and challenges of each tool; and (RQ4) the influences of each tool on the approaches taken by participants to complete the task. To address RQ2-RQ4, we conducted a qualitative analysis of participants' responses during an exit interview. We discuss implications from our results for designing tools to support users with complex search tasks.

While several approaches for improving search engines for the learning scenario have been proposed (e.g. a specific ranking function), instructional scaffolding (or simply scaffolding)-a traditional learning support strategy-has not been studied in the context of search as learning, despite being shown to be effective for improving learning in both digital and traditional learning contexts. When scaffolding is employed, instructors provide learners with support throughout their autonomous learning process. We hypothesize that the usage of scaffolding techniques within a search system can be an effective way to help learners achieve their learning objectives whilst searching. As such, this paper investigates the incorporation of scaffolding into a search system employing three different strategies (as well as a control condition): (i) AQe, the automatic expansion of user queries with relevant subtopics; (ii) CURATEDsc, the presenting of a manually curated static list of relevant subtopics on the search engine result page; and (iii) FEEDBACKsc, which projects real-time feedback about a user's exploration of the topic space on top of the CURATEDsc visualization. To investigate the effectiveness of these approaches with respect to human learning, we conduct a user study (N=126) where participants were tasked with searching and learning about topics such as genetically modified organisms. We find that (i) the introduction of the proposed scaffolding methods in the proposed topics does not significantly improve learning gains. However, (ii) it does significantly impact search behavior. Furthermore, (iii) immediate feedback of the participants' learning (FEEDBACKsc) leads to undesirable user behavior, with participants seemingly focusing on the feedback gauges instead of learning.

We do make choices about our reading, though, based on other factors than informational content. Some of these have been discussed in the literature, including convenience, preferences between paper and screen, and acquisition preferences. In this paper, we discuss books and reading as a performance. We examine the visual and cultural elements of books that influence the decisions we make about privacy or performance. We use these reflections to suggest a new form of information interaction, and make suggestions for a future program of research to support this new interaction.

It occurs in a social context, which influences both a reader's choices about what to read, and their understanding about what they read. Digitally, direct personal communication and online discussions are two examples of social reading activity. However, our understanding of social reading is still young: we know some elements of the activity, but we lack a comprehensive picture of its behavioural elements and how they interact. This study aims to bridge that existing gap. We undertook a diary study, supplemented with interviews to capture readers' social reading behaviours. Based on a qualitative analysis of that data, we propose a social reading journey model, that includes four activities: Inspiration and Motivation, Reading, Understanding and Enrich, and Social Interaction. We identify the flow of information interaction behaviour across the social reading journey, and the sources of online information that influence readers' reading choices and inform their understanding of what they read. Our findings provide a first model of social reading behaviour, that is a foundation for future research.

Simultaneously, recent concerns about so-called filter bubbles, misinformation and selective exposure are symptomatic of the disruptive potential of these digital news recommenders. Recommender systems can make or break filter bubbles, and as such can be instrumental in creating either a more closed or a more open internet. Current approaches to evaluating recommender systems are often focused on measuring an increase in user clicks and short-term engagement, rather than measuring the user's longer term interest in diverse and important information. This paper aims to bridge the gap between normative notions of diversity, rooted in democratic theory, and quantitative metrics necessary for evaluating the recommender system. We propose a set of metrics grounded in social science interpretations of diversity and suggest ways for practical implementations.

Various recommender systems have been designed to help people discover such information. No matter how accurately the recommender algorithms perform, users' engagement with recommended results has been complained being less than ideal. In this study, we touched on two human-centered objectives for recommender systems: user satisfaction and curiosity, both of which are believed to play roles in maintaining user engagement and sustain such engagement in the long run. Specifically, we leveraged the concept of surprise and used an existing computational model of surprise to identify relevantly surprising health articles aiming at improving user satisfaction and inspiring their curiosity. We designed a user study to first test the validity of the surprise model in a health news recommender system, called LuckyFind. Then user satisfaction and curiosity were evaluated. We find that the computational surprise model helped identify surprising recommendations at little cost of user satisfaction. Users gave higher ratings on interestingness than usefulness for those surprising recommendations. Curiosity was inspired more for those individuals who have a larger capacity to experience curiosity. Over half of the users have changed their preferences after using LuckyFind, either discovering new areas, reinforcing their existing interests, or stopping following those they did not want anymore. The insights of the research will make researchers and practitioners rethink the objectives of today's recommender systems as being more human-centered beyond algorithmic accuracy.

All these activities come at a ""cost'', but within the field of ISR there is no universally accepted definition of the concepts of Cost, Effort and Load (CEL). Instead, researchers have used the same terms interchangeably to describe similar but also different concepts. This lack of shared understanding has led to a disconnect between how these concepts are defined and discussed versus how they are interpreted and measured. Thus, the aim of this paper is two-fold: (i) to review the meaning of CEL related concepts used within ISR, and (ii) to create a shared taxonomy of the concepts relating to CEL in ISR. To seed our analysis, we conducted a literature review, where 397 papers were reviewed, and twenty-six papers that explicitly proposed measures or definitions of CEL were selected for analysis. By drawing upon theory from Psychology and other fields, we present the common definitions of CEL in order to ground our discussion of these concepts in ISR. We also highlight the issues associated with CEL measurement in ISR to help researchers reflect on the validity and precision of existing methods. We hope this perspectives paper serves as a basis for a taxonomy of how CEL concepts are used within ISR- where we have provided a series of working definitions that clearly delineate the different concepts being used, investigated and measured in ISR research.

In order to avoid overstraining these users, simplified interfaces that are reduced to the functionality and content which are relevant to the individual user are imperative. Gaze-contingent systems thus monitor viewing behavior during natural system interactions to predict relevant interface elements. The prediction performance is highly dependent on the underlying features and algorithm, especially when the interface consist of dynamic elements such as videos. In this paper, we conduct two studies with a total of 233 subjects in which we record the viewers' gaze while watching videos. We then compare the quality of preference predictions for video elements of majority voting to the performance of machine learning. Our results indicate that (1) majority voting can predict preferences with an accuracy of up to 73% (66%) for two (four) elements, (2) machine learning improves the performance to 82% (74%), (3) prediction accuracy depends on the strength of the user's preference for an element, and (4) we can rank preferences for individual elements.

However, eye-tracking studies have shown that users still fixate on ads, and even without direct gaze, ads still fall within a user's peripheral vision, which may negatively overload cognition. It is therefore unknown how blind, banner blindness, truly is, and what other effect ads may have on user's information seeking. To address this gap, a within-subjects design experiment was conducted with 37 participants who performed search tasks from the TREC 2017 Common Core News Collection, where 3 search tasks contained various types of ads, and one search task had no ads. Although our results showed that on average, participants retrieved similar amounts of relevant documents regardless of whether ads were present or absent, participants took significantly longer achieving this performance when ads were present. Furthermore, when ads were absent, participants reported less frustration, and not only believed they learned more, but a post-task recall test showed that participants actually did learn up to 38% more. Consequently, our findings suggest that banner blindness is more costly than just mere annoyance, and that the influence of ads on user's information retrieval recall may extend current theories of visual crowding.

In many of these prior studies, the task descriptions implicitly or explicitly conveyed an expectation of the amount of information needed to satisfy the task requirements in terms of number of pages (e.g., find N webpages on topic X) or the time to spend on the task (e.g., search until time is up) rather than allowing the participant to determine how much information was needed. In this lab-based study, we investigated the effects of time constraints on information search and decision-making. Participants completed a series of decision-making tasks with half of the participants receiving a 5-minute time constraint and half given no time guidance. They were asked to make good, specific recommendations for a friend, and they had considerable latitude in deciding how much information they needed. Results showed that participants in the time constraint condition made their decisions faster but there were few significant differences in measures of search behaviors between the time constraint conditions (RQ1). Qualitative analysis indicated that participants adapted their decision task by varying their recommendations in their specificity, justification strength, and contents in both time conditions (RQ2). Finally, we found evidence that the impact of the time constraint on time- and task-related perceptions was moderated by the extent to which participants adapted their decision task (RQ3).

Built based on the inspection of 1,000 real-life questions issued to a web search engine, the taxonomy reflects the recent search behavior of users and enables deep understanding of user intents, goals, and expected answers. This taxonomy is more fine-grained than previous query taxonomies, and is designed with the ultimate goal of reducing the inherent ambiguity in determining the intent of questions. In addition, we describe the formal procedure for conducting an editorial study of the taxonomy including its evaluation. The adopted procedure aims to increase assessor agreement without incurring too much overhead. Our results demonstrate that, despite being more fine-grained, the proposed intent categories result in higher agreement between assessors compared to an existing, commonly used taxonomy.

An editorial study, where participants assess the usefulness of the answers they received in response to their questions, as well as 12 different aspects associated with the answers, indicates considerable correlation between certain aspects such as relevance, correctness, and completeness with the user-perceived usefulness of answers. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of some commonly used answer quality measures, such as ROGUE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore, demonstrating that these measures are limited in their ability to capture the aspects of usefulness and have room for improvement. The question answering dataset created in our work was made publicly available.

Even though people report being concerned about their privacy online, they often do not take steps to protect it. This is known as the 'privacy paradox' in the literature. In this work we study two well-known strategies based on theories from the behavioral sciences, nudging and boosting, which encourage users to browse in a way that their private data are less exposed. First, an online survey (N=127) tested the comprehensibility and efficacy of various facts (boosts), before the most effective of these were evaluated against 'nudge' interventions previously shown to be efficacious in lab-studies. A three week naturalistic study (N=68) using a browser extension revealed that both nudges and boosts improve browsing privacy, as approximated by different measures. Boosts are also shown to improve user knowledge about privacy in the short term, but the benefit weakens over time.

We demonstrate how straightforward is to capture behavioral data about the users at scale, by unobtrusively tracking their mouse cursor movements, and predict user's demographics information with reasonable accuracy using five lines of code. Based on our results, we propose an adversarial method to mitigate user profiling techniques that make use of mouse cursor tracking, such as the recurrent neural net we analyze in this paper. We also release our data and a web browser extension that implements our adversarial method, so that others can benefit from this work in practice.

As a motivational variable, interest has been widely studied in psychology and education, but has received less consistent and theory-driven attention in the field of interactive information retrieval (IIR). In this perspective paper we examine the role of interest and review how it has been studied and operationalized in IIR research. We draw upon a survey of 58 research studies that have manipulated, controlled or measured searcher interest in some way. The intent of the paper is to raise the profile of interest as a user-centred variable in IIR and to advocate for more conceptual and methodological consistency in future studies to better evaluate the impact of interest in information search.

Over the past decade, an increasing amount of attention has been paid towards investigating how cognitive biases influence information seeking and retrieval behaviours and outcomes. In particular, how such biases may negatively affect decisions because, for example, searchers may seek confirmatory but incorrect information or anchor on an initial search result even if its incorrect. In this perspectives paper, we aim to: (1) bring together and catalogue the emerging work on cognitive biases in the field of Information Retrieval; and (2) provide a critical review and reflection on these studies and subsequent findings. During our analysis we report on over thirty studies, that empirically examined cognitive biases in search, providing over forty key findings related to different domains (e.g. health, web, socio-political) and different parts of the search process (e.g. querying, assessing, judging, etc.). Our reflection highlights the importance of this research area, and critically discusses the limitations, difficulties and challenges when investigating this phenomena along with presenting open questions and future directions in researching the impact --- both positive and negative --- of cognitive biases in Information Retrieval.

The study relied on the Five-Factor Model and the Stereotype Content Model personality frameworks. An online data collection instrument was designed to give Alexa's users (N=50) stressful and non-stressful tasks followed by questions related to Alexa's personality. The assumption was that stressful and non-stressful tasks would frame a user's preference for Alexa's personality. Quantitative data of the participants? ratings of Alexa's responses, and qualitative comments about their ratings, experiences, and thoughts about Alexa were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics, tests of association, and thematic content analysis. The findings indicated that while the majority of users appreciate Alexa's personality as a way of making interactions more personal and enjoyable, some users prefer their conversational agent to be efficient, robotic-like, and devoid of a personality that might cause attachment. The participants described Alexa as competent in terms of information content and usability, and warm in terms of its personality manifestation, but wanted their ideal Alexa to be even more competent and warm. After experiencing stressful and non-stressful experimental conditions, the participants appreciated Alexa's highly competent and highly warm responses, while disparaging low-warmth/high-competence responses. The participants' comments indicated that after stressful tasks, they were more generous in their assessment of Alexa's performance, and valued manifestations of Alexa's warmth higher than after non-stressful tasks. Additionally, after the second group of tasks/towards the end of the study, the participants tended to score low warmth/high competence responses higher, which might indicate a slight preference for competence after longer interactions or a user's fatigued state. The implications of the findings on the design of conversational interfaces and study limitations are discussed.

We refer to this as tip of the tongue (TOT) known-item retrieval, named after the cognitive state of not being able to retrieve an item from memory. Using movie search as a case study, we explore the characteristics of questions posed by searchers in TOT states in a community question answering website. We analyze how searchers express their information needs during TOT states in the movie domain. Specifically, what information do searchers remember about the item being sought and how do they convey this information? Our results suggest that searchers use a combination of information about: (1) the content of the item sought, (2) the context in which they previously engaged with the item, and (3) previous attempts to find the item using other resources (e.g., search engines). Additionally, searchers convey information by sometimes expressing uncertainty (i.e., hedging), opinions, emotions, and by performing relative (vs. absolute) comparisons with attributes of the item. As a result of our analysis, we believe that searchers in TOT states may require specialized query understanding methods or document representations. Finally, our preliminary retrieval experiments show the impact of each information type presented in information requests on retrieval performance.

Building a high-quality document viewer often exceeds the resources of many researchers and so, in this paper, we describe the design and architecture of our new open-source document viewer, Spectator. In particular, we provide a look into the algorithmic details of how Spectator accomplishes tasks like mapping annotations back to the canonical document. Moreover, we provide a sampling of the use cases that we envision for Spectator, potential future additions depending on community need and support, and highlight situations where Spectator may not be a good fit. Furthermore, we provide a brief description of the sample application that we bundle with Spectator to demonstrate how one might use it within the context of a larger system.

However, many researchers require to develop an app that collects useful information from users while they search on their phones or participate in a user study. In this paper, we aim to address this need by providing a comprehensive Android app, called Omicron, which can be used to collect mobile query logs and perform user studies on mobile devices. Omicron, at its current version, can collect users' mobile queries, relevant documents, sensor data as well as user activity and interaction data in various study settings. Furthermore, we designed Omicron in such a way that it is conveniently extendable to conduct more specific studies and collect other types of sensor data. Finally, we provide a tool to monitor the participants and their data both during and after the collection process.

While re-use of some study aspects can be difficult due to the varied nature of IIR studies, the use of pre- and post-task self-reported measures is widespread and relatively standardised. Nevertheless, re-use of elements in this area is also limited, in part because systems used to implement them are not able to exchange question, instruments, or complete study setups. To address this, this paper presents a standardised, but extendable, format for IIR survey instrument exchange.

This work has primarily focused on communication of information exclusively via spoken dialogue. While this is sufficient for simple question type queries, it is an inefficient means of engagement for more complex or exploratory queries. We introduce a prototype multi-view search interface which combines a conversational search assistant with an extended standard graphical search interface.

This system integrates directly into Slack, a chat-messaging platform where users will collaborate. Through our system, the Wizard plays the role of a conversational search system that can search for information, send relevant web results, and message users. In our research, we study three Wizard conditions: bot\_info, bot\_dialog, and bot\_task, which differ in terms of how the Wizard can intervene in a conversation. The intervention modes follow the mixed-initiative framework by Chu-Carroll and Brown~\citechu1997tracking and provide us a foundation to study system initiative for conversational search. In this paper, we describe our design decisions and technical details on how we implemented the system.

Forking allows multiple annotations to exist for the same text. EntiTies enables texts and annotations to be easily shared with others or kept private.

Investigating Voice-Based Suggestions for Conversational News Recommendation	2020	short	437–441	completed; domain;news; design;type;exploratory; design;method;user study; mark; infrastructure;amazon alexa	dialogue systems; news recommendation	One of the key benefits of voice-based personal assistants is the potential to proactively recommend relevant and interesting information. One of the most valuable sources of such information is the News. However, in order for the user to hear the news that is useful and relevant to them, it must be recommended in an interesting and informative way. However, to the best of our knowledge, \em how to present a news item for a voice-based recommendation remains an open question. In this paper, we empirically compare different ways of recommending news, or specific news items, in a voice-based conversational setting. Specifically, we study the user engagement and satisfaction with five different variants of presenting news recommendations: (1) a generic news briefing; (2) news about a specific entity relevant to the current conversation; (3) news about an entity from a past conversation; (4) news on a trending news topic; and (5) the default - a suggestion to talk about news in general. Our results show that entity-based news recommendations exhibit 29% higher acceptance compared to briefing recommendations, and almost 100% higher acceptance compared to recommending generic or trending news. Our investigation into the presentation of news recommendations and the resulting insights could make voice assistants more informative and engaging.

While prior work typically considers learning as something that happens at some point during the search session, we are interested in when during the search session learning occurs. In order to answer this question, we here present the results of a user study ($N=64$) in which searchers were tasked with learning about a topic by searching the web for 20 minutes; they were prompted at regular intervals during the search session on their knowledge about the topic. We find that for study participants with little to no prior knowledge the learning gains are sublinear, while participants with some prior knowledge have the largest knowledge gains towards the end of the search session.

For product search, extensive user histories about purchases and ratings have been exploited. However, for general entity search, such as for books on specific topics or travel destinations with certain features, personalization is largely underexplored. In this paper, we address personalization of book search, as an exemplary case of entity search, by exploiting sparse user profiles obtained through online questionnaires. We devise and compare a variety of re-ranking methods based on language models or neural learning. Our experiments show that even very sparse information about individuals can enhance the effectiveness of the search results.

Gaze behavior can be captured with eye tracking and described with word-eye-fixations. Word-eye-fixations contain the user's accumulated gaze fixation duration on each individual word of a web page. In this work, we analyze the role of word-eye-fixations for predicting query terms. We investigate the relationship between a range of in-session features, in particular, gaze data, with the query terms and train models for predicting query terms. We use a dataset of 50 search sessions obtained through a lab study in the social sciences domain. Using established machine learning models, we can predict query terms with comparably high accuracy, even with only little training data. Feature analysis shows that the categories Fixation, Query Relevance and Session Topic contain the most effective features for our task.

However, for an open-domain conversational system to be coherent and engaging, it must be able to maintain the user's interest for extended periods, without sounding ""boring"" or ""annoying"". In this paper, we investigate one natural approach to this problem of modulating response prosody, i.e., changing the pitch and cadence of the response to indicate delight, sadness or other common emotions, as well as using pre-recorded interjections. Intuitively, this approach should improve the naturalness of the conversation, but attempts to quantify the effects of prosodic modulation on user satisfaction and engagement remain challenging. To accomplish this, we report results obtained from a large-scale empirical study that measures the effects of prosodic modulation on user behavior and engagement across multiple conversation domains, both immediately aftereach turn, and at the overall conversation level. Our results indicate that the prosody modulation significantly increases both immediate and overall user satisfaction. However, since the effects vary across different domains, we verify that prosody modulations do not substitute for coherent, informative content of the responses. Together, our results provide useful tools and insights for improving the naturalness of responses in conversational systems.

The visual attention features are introduced into good abandonment prediction for the first time and proved to be able to improve the prediction accuracy.

Results-to-date show that there is variation by domain in the choice of resource, choice of search tool, and judgment of credibility. The results also show that while the students are able to make good judgements regarding the credibility of resources, that judgement is not always reflected in the resources they actually choose to use.

We find that as our participants become more accustomed to the system they begin to subtly alter their behaviours and interactions with the system. Using their shared experiences, we distill these into insights that may inform the design of similar systems.

These evaluations provide researchers and developers with first approximations of the likely performance of a new system and help weed out bad ideas before presenting them to users. However, offline evaluation cannot accurately assess novel, relevant recommendations, because the most novel items were previously unknown to the user, so they are missing from the historical data and cannot be judged as relevant. We present a simulation study to estimate the error that such missing data causes in commonly-used evaluation metrics in order to assess its prevalence and impact. We find that missing data in the rating or observation process causes the evaluation protocol to systematically mis-estimate metric values, and in some cases erroneously determine that a popularity-based recommender outperforms even a perfect personalized recommender. Substantial breakthroughs in recommendation quality, therefore, will be difficult to assess with existing offline techniques.

Reflecting on a case study presenting fieldwork observations of how adults with intellectual disability engage with videos on the Youtube platform, we propose a framework to define and evaluate the accessibility of such large video repositories, from an informational perspective. The proposed framework nuances the concept of information accessibility from that of the accessibility of information access interfaces themselves (generally catered for under web accessibility guidelines), or that of the documents (generally covered in general accessibility guidelines). It also includes a notion of search (or browsing) accessibility, which reflects the ability to reach the document containing the information. In the context of large information repositories, this concept goes beyond how the documents are organized into how automated processes (browsing or searching) can support users. In addition to the framework we also detail specifics of document accessibility for videos. The framework suggests a multi-dimensional approach to information accessibility evaluation which includes both cognitive and sensory aspects. This framework can serve as a basis for practitioners when designing video information repositories accessible to people with intellectual disability, and extends on the information presentation guidelines such as suggested by the WCAG.

These comments may contain information that signals a commentator could be at risk of potential harm. Due to a large amount of responses generated from these videos, it is very challenging for social media teams to respond to a vulnerable commentator who is at risk. We considered this issue as a multi-class problem and triaged viewers' comments into one of four severity levels. Using current state-of-the-art classifiers, we propose a model enriched with psycho-linguistic and sentiment features that can detect critical comments in need of urgent support. On average, our model achieved up to 60% precision, recall, and f1-score which indicates the effectiveness of the model.

Participants' knowledge on the topic was measured before (t1) and after the learning phase (t2) with a free essay task. During the web search, the time participants spent on different information resources was measured, differentiating between text-dominated websites and videos. Furthermore, to examine the role of learners' cognitive abilities, their working memory capacity (WMC) and reading comprehension ability (RCA) were assessed. Results of a hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that after controlling for prior knowledge, WMC and RCA positively predicted students' learning outcome, as measured by the number of correct concepts included in essays composed after search. Moreover, the time spent on text-dominated websites was also associated with better learning outcomes. In contrast, the time spent watching videos was not beneficial. To conclude, our findings provide preliminary evidence that the time leaners spend on text-dominated websites and on videos might not contribute equally to the acquisition of conceptual knowledge in SAL tasks.

Furthermore, we examined the influence of device type on students' learning outcomes by analyzing the number of pro and con arguments included in a subsequent essay task. Results showed that on laptops students used more queries than on smartphones. In contrast, no differences were found in search query length or in the number of pro and con arguments in the essay. Moreover, irrespective of device type, average search query length was positively associated with the number of con arguments. To conclude, the present study provides first indications that smartphone usage could be incorporated in the classroom for Web inquiry tasks.

Only if information resources are represented at an appropriate level that matches the ability of user groups can the success and efficiency of information searching be realized. Information systems for young children frequently ignore the problem of information representation, which renders the use of such systems difficult for young children and parents. This study focused on young children's picture book searching demand and carried out behavioral experiments by simulating an information searching system to extract young children's information representation of picture books. The findings include 8 representation categories and 19 elements that children use for searching picture books, which may contribute to the development of a picture book searching system for young children.

Interfaces used in gathering such ratings are designed in an ad-hoc fashion as it has not yet been investigated which design yields high-quality ratings. This work describes how to design user interfaces for gathering high-quality ratings with third-party annotators. In a user study, we compare a base interface that consolidates best practices from literature, an interface with clear definitions and an interface in which tasks are separated visually. We find that these interfaces yield annotations of high quality and separation of tasks. We find no significant improvements in quality between UIs. This work can serve as a starting point for researchers and practitioners interested in collecting high-quality dialogue user satisfaction ratings using third-party annotators.

In this exploratory study, we observed four older adults with distinctive backgrounds to evaluate a set of preselected webpages in response to hypothetical tasks and interviewed them based on the recording of their eye- and mouse-movements during their evaluation. Results revealed that older adults consistently relied on a set of limited number of webpage or language indicators to evaluate webpages. They had misconceptions concerning some quality indicators such as references and website types. The results suggest that future interventions to improve older adults' ability to evaluate online health information quality should consider their unique behavioral patterns and preconceptions of internet technologies.

What existing research there is has mostly focused on the impact on information comprehension and spelling. However, people with dyslexia often face considerable memory impairment that can affect their learning. This paper reports findings from retrospective think-aloud (RTA) observations with 13 undergraduates with dyslexia, focusing on the memory-related barriers they face and the workarounds they use to overcome these barriers. An enhanced understanding of the full range of barriers faced by information-seekers with dyslexia can inform the design of dyslexia-aware digital information environments and information literacy programs. These can 'level the information playing field' by helping to break down barriers to information and, in turn, to knowledge creation.

Conclusions drawn from the scores produced by automatic metrics inevitably lead to important decisions about future directions. Metrics commonly applied include ROUGE, adopted from the related field of summarization, BLEU and Meteor, both of the latter originally developed for evaluation of machine translation. In this paper, we pose the important question, given that question answering is evaluated by application of automatic metrics originally designed for other tasks, to what degree do the conclusions drawn from such metrics correspond to human opinion about system-generated answers? We take the task of machine reading comprehension (MRC) as a case study and to address this question, provide a new method of human evaluation developed specifically for the task at hand.

We describe an auxiliary support tool referred to as the ""Matrix''. The Matrix tool was designed to support searchers with comparative search tasks, which require comparing items along different dimensions. The Matrix was designed as a grid of rows and columns representing the items and dimensions related to a comparative task. The Matrix was integrated with a custom-built search interface, which allowed users to search for information and drag-and-drop relevant passages directly into cells in the Matrix. We investigate the following general question: Given a partially completed Matrix, can a system automatically populate empty cells in the Matrix with relevant passages? To this end, we conducted two crowdsourced studies in which participants were assigned comparative tasks and asked to use our system (integrated search interface + Matrix) to populate every cell in the Matrix. After gathering this data, we evaluated machine-learned models for ranking passages in response to an empty Matrix cell and partially completed Matrix. We address two research questions: (RQ1) What are useful types of features for this predictive task? and (RQ2) How does performance vary based on the level of Matrix completion? We view our research as a step towards designing support tools that: (1) help users organize information while searching and (2) can autocomplete search tasks by exploiting the task structure and a searcher's partial solution.

Therefore, it is unclear how to exactly support complex searches for these types of content. To contribute to fill this gap, this paper focuses on the role of context in Search User Interfaces (SUIs) for 3D objects and shows how it is envisioned by digital humanists in an exploratory user study. An evaluation of interactive mockups of a prospective search engine, contextualized by 2D, enhanced 2D and 3D maps, shows the scholars' preference for three-dimensional map views. A further qualitative analysis also suggests the need for more hybrid ways to visualize spatial context of 3D objects. This includes object properties, object relationships and spatial cues. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of SUI support for accessing the growing number of reality-based 3D models and virtual reconstructions.

Based on primary and secondary sources, we developed a dataset of IPA-directed personality utterances and analyzed IPA responses to such utterances from four major IPAs-Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana-using Fiske's stereotype content model. The model supports classification of user perceptions of other people or objects on warmth and competence dimensions. The findings suggest that while all four IPAs were frequently perceived as competent, Alexa and Siri were more frequently perceived as low-warmth compared to the higher-warmth Google Assistant and Cortana. Future work aims to verify the initial classification of IPA personality responses using warmth-competence dimensions, and test user demographic and situational preferences for personality manifestations in IPA responses.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of cognitive task complexity on the types of information considered useful for a task. We characterize information types from two perspectives. From one perspective, we classify task-related information items based on inherent characteristics (referred to as info-types): factual statements, concepts/definitions, opinionated statements, and insights---tips/advice related to the task domain. From a second perspective, we used Byströ m and J\""a rvelin's framework~\citebystrom1995 to define information types based on how the information might be used to complete the task (referred to as functional roles): (1) to help the task doer understand the task requirements (problem information); (2) to help the task doer strategize on how to approach the task (problem-solving information); and (3) to help the task doer learn about the task domain (domain information). Our results suggest that: (1) cognitive task complexity influences the functional roles of information items deemed useful for the task (RQ1); (2) certain info-types are more (or less) likely to play certain functional roles (RQ2); and task complexity influences the variety of functional roles played by info-types (RQ3).

Key differences in the searches are highlighted and the use of search genre for accommodating all university students are discussed.

We conducted a lab-based eye-tracking study to investigate search time, behavior, and user satisfaction with ads of good or bad qualities positioned at the top or middle of organic results. Our findings suggest that users pay attention to ads regardless of their quality or position. However, they tend to pay different amounts of attention to organic results and SERPs because of ad quality. We also found that user satisfaction and the chance of clicking on an ad vary according to ad quality and position.

These updates can either be sent to users' mobile devices as push notifications or be silently deposited in an inbox to be consumed - the important difference is whether the user is interrupted by the delivery. Previously, a two-year study examining user attention under these different mechanisms revealed interesting findings about users' information consumption behavior, but the conclusions were marred by a few methodological shortcomings. We present a reproducibility study that follows the same design as the original evaluation, but corrects its flaws. We find that most conclusions from the original study are confirmed, although there are some surprising differences as well. Overall, the magnitude of the observed effects are not as strong as in the original study.

We target context-of-use intents, such as the activity for which a product is used and the target audience for a product, which are subjective and not usually indexed as product attributes in the catalog. We describe a method to predict latent query intents: we extract intents from product reviews on amazon.com and, using behavioral purchase signals that associate queries with the reviewed products, train query classifiers that label queries with the intents extracted from reviews. For example, we predict the activity ""running"" for the query ""adidas mens pants."" We show that our method can predict latent intents not indexed directly in the product catalog.

Typical interactive information retrieval tasks ask computers to support the traversal and exploration of large, complex information spaces. The implicit assumption is that they are to support users in simplifying the complexity (i.e. in creating order from chaos). But for some types of task, particularly those that involve the creative application or synthesis of knowledge or the creation of new knowledge, this assumption may be incorrect. It is increasingly evident that perfect order-and the systems we create with it-support highly-structured information tasks well, but provide poor support for less-structured tasks. We need digital information environments that help create a little more chaos from order to spark creative thinking and knowledge creation. This paper argues for the need for information systems that offer what we term 'bounded chaos', and offers research directions that may support the creation of such interfaces

In this work, we analyze how the level of health literacy is related to the eye movements of users searching the web for health information. We performed a user study with 30 participants that were asked to search online in the context of three work task situations defined by the authors. Their eye interactions with the Search Results Page and the Result Pages were logged using an eye-tracker and later analyzed. When searching online for health information, people with adequate health literacy spend more time and have more fixations on Search Result Pages. In this type of page, they also pay more attention to the results' hyperlink and snippet and click in more results too. In Result Pages, adequate health literacy users spend more time analyzing textual content than people with lower health literacy. We found statistical differences in terms of clicks, fixations, and time spent that could be used as a starting point for further research. That we know of, this is the first work to use an eye-tracker to explore how users with different health literacy search online for health-related information. As traditional instruments are too intrusive to be used by search engines, an automatic prediction of health literacy would be very useful for this type of system.

When people conduct these health searches, searching for information about medical treatments is among the more common reasons. While being a convenient and fast method to collect information, when used by people for health search, search engines can be biased toward results saying treatments are helpful, regardless of the truth. The presence of incorrect information in search results may potentially cause harm, especially if people believe what they read without further research or professional medical advice. In this paper, we aim to better understand the decision making process of determining the efficacy of medical treatments using search result pages. We conducted a think-aloud study in order to gain insights on strategies people use during online search for health related topics. We found that, even when participants are careful and focused on the task, biased search engine results can significantly influence people to make decisions consistent with the bias. The chief reason biased search engines results were able to influence participants is that participants often considered what the majority of the search results stated as part of their decision-making. We also found that participants looked for indications of authoritativeness and quality when evaluating online content. While rank bias and a bias towards wanting treatments to be helpful has been found in prior studies, our participants did not reveal these biases as part of their spoken thoughts. Our results imply that more attention should be paid to search engines' biases given people's bias towards accepting the most common answer in the results as the correct answer. When search results are biased toward incorrect results for health-related searches, dire consequences may be the result.

Prior research has focused on using translation to provide users with information written in other languages, yet there are still many languages with little or no such resources. In this paper, we propose the use of intercomprehension -- a form of communication in which speakers of two different languages communicate using their own languages, mainly due to similarities between the languages. Accordingly, we conducted a user study on six Sub-Saharan languages to explore: user interaction behaviour in a retrieval environment where intercomprehension is expected; to investigate the usefulness of search results that assume intelligibility and relevance; and investigate affective episodes associated with intercomprehension in retrieval through retrospection. Although intercomprehension may come with a cost to understand unfamiliar languages, our results show that user preference of ranking of search results in related languages incorporates intelligibility. Our findings also suggest that intercomprehension is useful in retrieval for related languages -- users are able to identify relevant documents as well as complete search tasks by applying intercomprehension. However, the negative emotions or frustration associated with intercomprehension suggest that this type of interaction should be used in extreme cases where there are no or very few relevant documents in the language of the query.

Since customers cannot physically touch or try out an item before buying it, they must assess its quality from information gathered online. In a typical eCommerce setting, the customer is presented with seller-generated content from the product catalog, such as an image of the product, a textual description, and lists or comparisons of attributes. In addition to catalog attributes, customers often have access to customer-generated content such as reviews and product questions and answers. In a crowdsourced study, we asked crowd workers to compare product pairs from kitchen, electronics, home, beauty and office categories. In a side-by-side comparison, we asked them to choose the product that is higher quality, and further to identify the attributes that contributed to their judgment, where the attributes were both seller-generated and customer-generated. We find that customers tend to perceive more expensive items as higher quality but that their purchase decisions are uncorrelated with quality, suggesting that customers seek a trade-off between price and quality when making purchase decisions. Crowd workers placed a higher value on attributes derived from customer-generated content such as reviews than on catalog attributes. Among the catalog attributes, brand, item material and pack size were most often selected. Finally, attributes with a low correlation with perceived quality are nonetheless useful in predicting purchases in a machine-learned system.

Usefulness refers to the contribution of search results to a larger task generating information search. This study analyses articles on interactive information retrieval which either predict the usefulness of documents retrieved or evaluate search systems by the usefulness of search results. The aim is to systematize the findings of these studies by categorizing the types of usefulness and their predictor types. Significant empirical associations between predictor types and usefulness are systematized, too. The data consists of articles in journals or conference proceedings focusing on the usefulness of search results either in web or database environment. The results indicate that there is a growing trend to complement topical relevance by the usefulness of search results in evaluating search systems. Search tasks typically instruct participants to search information for a writing task. Perceived usefulness of search results is the established measure in studies, although there are alternative measures in use. Significant associations between predictors and usefulness do not accumulate much but vary notably. Growth of knowledge on the usefulness of search results is based on the increasing number and variety of proposition supported empirically.

Prior studies using PS tests have demonstrated that PS affects multiple factors in Information Retrieval (IR), such as a user's search performance, interaction with the system, time spent completing tasks, and subjective impression of their workload. With greater knowledge of PS, systems could be designed that accommodate users with low PS to improve their overall search experience. However, in this perspectives paper, we analyse how PS tests have been used in IR, and identify multiple uncertainties regarding PS content, administration, analysis, and reporting of findings. Consequently, we aim to stir discussion between IR researchers by drawing awareness to these issues. As a result, we further discuss challenges involved in advancing how future PS tests are used in IR. Finally, we propose recommendations that have the potential for enhancing the reliability and validity of current PS tests.

An eye-tracking study was conducted where participants read short news articles, and rated them as relevant or irrelevant for answering a trigger question. We encode participants' eye-movement scanpaths as images, and then train a convolutional neural network classifier using these scanpath images. The trained classifier is used to predict participants' perceived-relevance of news articles from the corresponding scanpath images. This method is content-independent, as the classifier does not require knowledge of the screen-content, or the user's information-task. Even with little data, the image classifier can predict perceived-relevance with up to 80% accuracy. When compared to similar eye-tracking studies from the literature, this scanpath image classification method outperforms previously reported metrics by appreciable margins. We also attempt to interpret how the image classifier differentiates between scanpaths on relevant and irrelevant documents.

However, in the context of web search, this assumption does not hold. Modern search engine result pages (SERPs) are composed of a variety of item types (e.g., news, web, entity, etc.), and their influence on browsing behavior is largely unknown. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical analysis of pop- ular web search queries and investigate how different item types influence how people interact on SERPs. We then infer a user browsing model given people's interactions with SERP items - creating a data-driven metric based on item type. We show that the proposed metric leads to more accurate estimates of: (1) total gain, (2) total time spent, and (3) stopping depth - without requiring extensive parameter tuning or a priori relevance information. These results suggest that item heterogeneity should be accounted for when de- veloping metrics for SERPs. While many open questions remain concerning the applicability and generalizability of data-driven metrics, they do serve as a formal mechanism to link observed user behaviors directly to how performance is measured. From this approach, we can draw new insights regarding the relationship between behavior and performance - and design data-driven metrics based on real user behavior rather than using metrics reliant on some hypothesized model of user browsing behavior.

Current assistants offer less support for accomplishing more complex tasks comprising multiple steps. These tasks sometimes require the ability to leverage the capabilities of multiple devices. Ideal smart assistants for such complex scenarios would track task progress and recommend useful and appropriate information at every step of the procedure. To this end, we introduce the novel notion of step-wise recommendation as a means of automatically providing guidance relevant to the current step in a complex task. We employ a common real-life scenario for this purpose: recipe preparation. We demonstrate how a smart assistant can be developed to offer support for complex tasks enabled by multi-modal inputs and outputs through multiple devices (i.e., smart speakers, tablets, or other smart devices available in kitchens). We develop step-wise recommendation models for this scenario and analyze their efficacy for: (1) different prediction tasks (e.g., resources, devices), and (2) different contextual information used to make the prediction (e.g., completed steps, current step, and importantly, future steps). Our recommendation model achieves a prediction accuracy of 83-96%, depending on the prediction task and context used. The findings have implications for the design of intelligent systems to help people accomplish complex tasks.

However, current search systems still face plenty of challenges when applied in supporting users engaging in complex search tasks. To address this issue, we seek to explore the dynamic nature of complex search tasks from process-oriented perspective by identifying and predicting implicit task states. Specifically, based upon the Web search logs and user annotation data (regarding information seeking intentions in local search steps, in-situ search problems, and help needed) collected from 132 search sessions in two controlled lab studies, we developed two task state frameworks based on intention state and problem-help state respectively and examined the connection between task states and search behaviors. We report that (1) complex search tasks of different types can be deconstructed and disambiguated based on the associated nonlinear state transition patterns; and (2) the identified task states that cover multiple subtle factors of user cognition can be predicted from search behavioral signals using supervised learning algorithms. This study reveals the way in which complex search tasks are unfolded and manifested in users' search interactions and paves the way for developing state-aware adaptive search supports and system evaluation frameworks.

Different methods are used in those investigations, which often result in abstract representations of research phases, taxonomies of scholarly activities, in conceptual frameworks, or in scholarly ontologies. While the aim of these representations is to inform the design of the digital infrastructures, the complexity and diversity of scholarly work pose the question about the applicability of those models for design and evaluation of research infrastructures and tools. In this paper, we explore a methodology to analyze workflows from a micro-perspective, which aims at capturing the transitions between activities. We use two scholarly projects as case studies, describe their research activities in detail by using existing ontologies and describe the connections between activities, and analyse generic transitions. We discuss what kinds of implications this approach has to evaluation and design of information systems and services to facilitate scholars' complex and varied research processes.

The fear is that these technologies are undermining democracy by swaying opinion and creating an uninformed, polarised populace. The literature in this space is mostly techno-centric, addressing the impact of technology. In contrast, our work is the first research in the information interaction field to examine changing viewpoints from a human-centric perspective. It provides a new understanding of view change and how we might support informed, autonomous view change behaviour. We interviewed 18 participants about a self-identified change of view, and the information touchpoints they engaged with along the way. In this paper we present the information types and sources that informed changes of viewpoint, and the ways in which our participants interacted with that information. We describe our findings in the context of the techno-centric literature and suggest principles for designing digital information environments that support user autonomy and reflection in viewpoint formation.

We recruited a broad range of participants (N=110) using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service. The survey asked people to describe a recent task in which they searched across multiple sessions, to recall the reasons they started and stopped the most recent search session for the task, and to explain methods they used for reacquainting themselves with the task at the beginning of the most recent session. Across a broad range of tasks reported by our participants, our results show that a majority of the cross-session work tasks involved high levels of cognitive complexity, consultation with additional human information sources (in addition to search engines), and often involved multiple devices (e.g., computer and smartphone). Our analysis of reasons why people stopped and restarted search sessions extends and validates the reasons outlined in Lin and Belkin's model of Multiple Information Seeking Episodes and previous results from MacKay and Watters' study of multi-session search. We also identified methods that searchers use to re-acquaint themselves when restarting multi-session searches, and reasons why they may choose not to use any re-acquainting method. Our results update prior work and provide insights about how search systems can better support cross-session work tasks.

Document recommendation is a new and under-explored application area, in which both re-finding and discovery of documents need to be supported. In this paper we provide an initial exploration of users' experience with recommended documents, with a focus on how prior interactions influence recognition and interest. Through a field study of more than 100 users, we investigate the effects of past interactions with recommended documents on users' recognition of, prior intent to open, and interest in the documents. We examined different presentations of interaction history, and the recency and richness of prior interaction. We found that presentation only influenced recognition time. Our findings also indicate that people are more likely to recognize documents they had accessed recently and to do so more quickly. Similarly, documents that people had interacted with more deeply were also more frequently and quickly recognized. However, people were more interested in older documents or those with which they had less involved interactions. This finding suggests that in addition to helping users quickly access documents they intend to re-find, document recommendation can add value in helping users discover other documents. Our results offer implications for designing document recommendation systems that help users fulfil different needs.

Trust is a significant issue in the current information context due to fake news, echo chambers, filter bubbles, and confirmation biases which can result in a disconnect between human trust expectations and information trustworthiness, making it difficult to establish a feature space within which trust might be modeled. In response to this, we present our Cognitive Predicting Theory of Trust (CPTT) which allows trust to be modeled without the requirement of a predefined feature space. Drawn from the cognitive theory of Predictive Processing, CPTT describes how people form trust judgments based on cognitive predictions within a system of information interactions. We outline how this CPTT view of trust might be modeled using complex systems and provide examples showing how curation of the information interaction environment can affect the trust associated with the system. We conclude by proposing that our perspective opens up two avenues for exploration in Computer Human Information Interaction and Retrieval: (1) the need for alternative models, and (2) the value of curating the information environment.

It is our aim to better prepare system builders to grapple with these issues.

These challenges have potential negative impacts, especially in search domains such as health search. Existing information retrieval (IR) systems offer users little (if any) guidance as to how to reduce the likelihood of such negative impacts. The sum of these problems provides motivation for experiments to identify elements of existing IR environments that might provide low-cost options to the user for improved search outcomes. An online user study (N = 90) was performed allowing users to visit search results for 10 medical search tasks adapted from previous research. Analysis was performed on all search results visited in the experiment, with a total of 523 unique web pages collectively visited, with additional analysis performed on a set of 10,000 popular websites. The analysis suggests that the best strategy for users with the goal of protecting their privacy and simultaneously finding more accurate information for their medical search tasks, is to visit websites with .org and .gov in the URL. There is some evidence that HTTP is a useful predictor as well. Existing literature is limited with respect to utilization of these features and thus the findings, along with the annotations, are a key contribution for future research, for which possible directions are provided.

However, little research has been conducted to understand how people use search engines and other information resources to support creative endeavors in their day-to-day work and life. To gain a deeper understanding, we conducted a diary study by asking eleven participants to record diary entries about their own design-related creative projects over a two-week period. In this paper, we report the findings of our qualitative analysis of participants' diary entries and post-diary in-depth interviews. Specifically, we identified six types of information that were essential to design-related creative projects: procedural information, domain information, finished examples, tips/opinions/recommendations, information about specific topics, and inspiring/motivating information. For each type of information, we discuss participants' intents to use the information in their projects. We also describe challenges reported by our participants when they used search engines to address their information needs. Finally, we discuss implications of our findings for future research and the future design of search systems.

Consequently, they rely on intermediaries (e.g. caregivers) to solve their information needs. In the field of IIR, little is known about this user-intermediary interaction. More empirical data is therefore needed, both to understand how to support the intermediaries and increase the possibilities for people with intellectual impairments to solve information needs themselves. In this study, 25 people working with adults with intellectual impairments were interviewed about the information needs of the end users and the routines for solving these needs. The purpose was to explore when and how the user-intermediary interaction occurred. According to this study, most end users had limited access to information sources, and relied almost entirely on intermediaries. Further, the technological skills among the intermediaries seemed to affect access to and use of digital devices. Few end users expressed information needs outside everyday life. Moreover, information needs were given very little attention and solving such needs were not part of the routines at most facilities.

This is a challenging task. A topic suggested by the agent should be relevant to the person, appropriate for the conversation context, and the agent should have something interesting to say about it. Thus, a scripted, or one-size-fits-all, popularity-based topic suggestion is doomed to fail. Instead, we explore different methods for a personalized, contextual topic suggestion for open-domain conversations. We formalize the Conversational Topic Suggestion problem (CTS) to more clearly identify the assumptions and requirements. We also explore three possible approaches to solve this problem: (1) model-based sequential topic suggestion to capture the conversation context (CTS-Seq), (2) Collaborative Filtering-based suggestion to capture previous successful conversations from similar users (CTS-CF), and (3) a hybrid approach combining both conversation context and collaborative filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, we use real conversations collected as part of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018 Conversational AI challenge. The results are promising: the CTS-Seq model suggests topics with 23% higher accuracy than the baseline, and incorporating collaborative filtering signals into a hybrid CTS-Seq-CF model further improves recommendation accuracy by 12%. Together, our proposed models, experiments, and analysis significantly advance the study of open-domain conversational agents, and suggest promising directions for future improvements.

By employing a Wizard of Oz (WoZ) methodology and developing a conversational framework, in this work we study how participants (n=28) interact with such a system in an attempt to solve recipe recommendation tasks. Our results are mostly encouraging for the future development of conversational agents in this context, however, they also provide insights into the complexities of building such a system that could convincingly engage with users in productive, human-like conversations.

Driver distractions typically fall into four categories-visual, cognitive, bio-mechanical, and auditory-and different technological solutions have been proposed to address these. Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs), such as Siri, is a recent example of such a technological solution that offers the potential for hands-free phone interaction through a voice-controlled interface. IPAs could potentially reduce visual and bio-mechanical distractions if they are usable enough to not increase a driver's cognitive load. We present the results of a controlled experiment with the aim of understanding how the use of Siri while driving compares to manual interaction in terms of usability and distractions. We also tested these two interaction types in the lab in order to understand how the main driving task influences Siri's (perceived) usability. Our study shows that Siri is not ready for every-day use in the car: interacting with Siri while driving is likely to be unsafe for most participants, especially less experienced drivers. Participants were distracted by Siri due to its over-reliance on visual feedback as well as frequent time-outs by Siri when waiting for a response from a driver occupied with the road environment. Speech recognition quality in a noisy car as well as problematic multi-lingual speech recognition in general are other issues that resulted in low usability and more cognitive distractions. While interacting with Siri may be hands-free, it does not provide an eyes-free and distraction-free experience yet.

Future information systems will be able to exploit this valuable knowledge source and to retrieve arguments relevant and convincing to our specific need---all with an interface as intuitive as asking your friend ""Why ..."". Although recent advancements in argument mining, conversational search, and voice recognition have put such systems within reach, many questions remain open, especially on the interface side. In this regard the paper at hand presents the first study of argument search behavior. We conduct an online-survey and a focused user study, putting emphasis on what people expect argument search to be like, rather than on what current first-generation systems provide. Our participants expected to use voice-based argument search mostly at home, but also together with others. Moreover, they expect such search systems to provide rich information on retrieved arguments, such as the source, supporting evidence, and background knowledge on entities or events mentioned. In observed interactions with a simulated system we found that the participants adapted their search behavior to different types of tasks, and that up-front categorization of the retrieved arguments is perceived as helpful if this is short. Our findings are directly applicable to the design of argument search systems, not only voice-based ones.

Document-centered assistance, for example to help an individual quickly review a document, has seen less significant progress, even though it has the potential to tremendously increase a user's productivity. This type of document-centered assistance is the focus of this paper. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We first present a survey to understand the space of document-centered assistance and the capabilities people expect in this scenario. (2) We investigate the types of queries that users will pose while seeking assistance with documents, and show that document-centered questions form the majority of these queries. (3) We present a set of initial machine learned models that show that (a) we can accurately detect document-centered questions, and (b) we can build reasonably accurate models for answering such questions. These positive results are encouraging, and suggest that even greater results may be attained with continued study of this interesting and novel problem space. Our findings have implications for the design of intelligent systems to support task completion via natural interactions with documents.

Conversational assistants, such as Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana, can help users to complete various types of tasks. This requires an accurate understanding of the user's information need as the conversation evolves into multiple turns. Finding relevant context in a conversation's history is challenging because of the complexity of natural language and the evolution of a user's information need. In this work, we present an extensive analysis of language, relevance, dependency of user utterances in a multi-turn information-seeking conversation. To this aim, we have annotated relevant utterances in the conversations released by the TREC CaST 2019 track. The annotation labels determine which of the previous utterances in a conversation can be used to improve the current one. Furthermore, we propose a neural utterance relevance model based on BERT fine-tuning, outperforming competitive baselines. We study and compare the performance of multiple retrieval models, utilizing different strategies to incorporate the user's context. The experimental results on both classification and retrieval tasks show that our proposed approach can effectively identify and incorporate the conversation context. We show that processing the current utterance using the predicted relevant utterance leads to a 38% relative improvement in terms of nDCG@20. Finally, to foster research in this area, we have released the dataset of the annotations.

Text descriptions do not describe all aspects of the audio content in detail. Query by vocal imitation (QBV) is a kind of query by example that lets users imitate the content of the audio they seek, providing an alternative search method to traditional text search. Prior work proposed several neural networks, such as TL-IMINET, for QBV, however, previous systems have not been deployed in an actual search engine nor evaluated by real users. We have developed a state-of-the-art QBV system (Vroom!) and a baseline query-by-text search engine (TextSearch). We deployed both systems in an experimental framework to perform user experiments with Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers. Results showed that Vroom! received significantly higher search satisfaction ratings than TextSearch did for sound categories that were difficult for subjects to describe by text. Results also showed a better overall ease-of-use rating for Vroom! than TextSearch on the sound library used in our experiments. These findings suggest that QBV, as a complimentary search approach to existing text-based search, can improve both search results and user experience.

We developed a simple predictive system to demonstrate the benefit of this method. It utilizes text-based querying and regular expression to suggest the most probable next numeric actions in the suggestion bar along with word suggestions. We evaluated this method in two user studies. The first explored number entry and the second explored editing. Results revealed that the proposed method significantly increases number entry and editing speed and accuracy. It reduces the number of actions needed per task. It also significantly reduces the time and effort needed to fix errors. Subjective analysis revealed that almost all participants found the method faster, more reliable, and easier to use than the conventional method, thus wanted to keep using it on their mobile devices.

In this paper, we utilize data from TASKer, a campus-based mobile crowd-sourcing platform, to empirically study and discover whether and how various context-aware notification strategies can help overcome such drawbacks. We first study worker interactions, in the absence of any notifications, to discover some spatio-temporal properties of task acceptance and completion. Based on these insights, we then experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of two novel, non-personal, context-driven notification strategies, comparing the outcomes to two different baselines (no-notification and random-notification). Finally, using the data from the random-notification mechanism, we derive a classification model, incorporating several novel contextual features, that can predict a worker's responsiveness to notifications with high accuracy. Our work extends the crowd-sourcing literature by emphasizing the power of smart notifications for greater worker engagement.

In an effort to aid users to review more efficiently, we sought to determine how document-level clustering may help users of a due diligence system during their workflow. Following an iterative design methodology, we conducted several user studies with different versions of a document-level clustering feature consisting of three distinct phases and 27 users. We found that the interface should adapt to a user's understanding of what ""similar documents"" means so that trust can be established in the feature. Furthermore, the ability to negotiate with the underlying algorithm is facilitated by the establishment of trust. Finally, while the usage of this feature may be influenced by a user's role, it remains primarily a project management tool.

In our daily life we use many computing devices running different versions of the same application such as email clients or social media platforms, which alert users about a new piece of information or event on all devices. In this paper we first present a study investigating the factors influencing users' decisions in handling notifications in a multi-device environment. We collected 57,242 in-the-wild notifications from 24 users over a period of 21 days. We found that users' decisions in handling notifications are impacted by their physical activity, location, network connectivity, application category and the device used for handling the previous notification. Finally, we show that an individualized model can predict the device on which the user will handle a notification in the given context with 82% specificity and 91% sensitivity.

As a result, non-traditional, yet active groups of users, such as children, experience challenges composing queries that can lead them to the retrieval of adequate results. To aid young users in formulating keyword queries that can facilitate their information-seeking process, we introduce ReQuIK, a multi-perspective query suggestion system for children. ReQuIK informs its suggestion process by applying (i) a strategy based on search intent to capture the purpose of a query, (ii) a ranking strategy based on a wide and deep neural network that considers both raw text and traits commonly associated with kid-related queries, (iii) a filtering strategy based on the readability levels of documents potentially retrieved by a query to favor suggestions that trigger the retrieval of documents matching children»s reading skills, and (iv) a content-similarity strategy to ensure diversity among suggestions. For assessing the quality of the system, we conducted initial offline and online experiments based on 591 queries written by 97 children, ages 6 to 13. The results of this assessment verified the correctness of ReQuIK»s recommendation strategy, the fact that it provides suggestions that appeal to children and ReQuIK»s ability to recommend queries that lead to the retrieval of materials with readability levels that correlate with children»s reading skills.

Twenty-four college students participated in this user study, where they were asked to search for two separate health issues respectively: multiple sclerosis and weight loss. The search logs were collected and analyzed afterwards. We classify the online information sources on both website level and webpage level, and a webpage classification scheme based on genre is proposed. Results suggest that users» selection of sources depends on different types of health issues in terms of urgency and complexity. Health-specific webpage is a popular source and highly adopted for both tasks, but it is particularly helpful for urgent and complex health conditions. Search engines could facilitate users to navigate among scattered health information and support concerns regarding common health issues.

The traditional solution offered by most database vendors is to use proprietary line-by-line 'query builders'. However, these offer limited support for error checking or query optimisation, and their output can often be compromised by errors and inefficiencies. Using the healthcare domain for context, we demonstrate a new approach to search strategy formulation in which concepts are expressed as objects on a two-dimensional canvas, and relationships are articulated using direct manipulation. This approach eliminates many sources of syntactic error, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers new ways to optimise, save and share search strategies and best practices

There is also a lack of agreement about whether or not digital humanists should have data and programming skills. Thus, their underlying needs for higher levels of flexibility and transparency may be contradicted by their explicit requests for user-friendly graphic user interfaces (GUIs), creating challenges for designing information systems in the digital humanities. This paper describes the experience of designing the Media Suite, which provides access to important Dutch audiovisual collections and is part of the Dutch infrastructure for digital humanities. We outline a solution to the conflicting needs of scholars, by combining a semi-traditional GUI with Jupyter Notebooks. This solution tackles the needs of both novice and advanced users in digital research methods in the humanities. This demonstration paper explains how the Media Suite and the Jupyter notebooks work together, and elaborates on the rationale behind the design choices. We also outline the implications this hybrid and extensible approach has for interface design for the information science and scholarly community.

Researchers have restricted time in which to design a study, develop a collection tool, collect data, analyze it, and report new insights. In particular, sufficient time and development skills are often required to create a tool that meets the needs of any particular web search behavior study. Coagmento is a tool that is developed for facilitating many of the needs for designing and running a lab study, from executing a session flow to collecting log data. By streamlining the programming of unique parts for a specific study, Coagmento helps researchers tailor various parts of running a user study, lowering the barrier for designing and conducting lab study experiments. One-click interactions with a graphical user interface permit researchers to operate through a web-based administrative service to generate stages, search tasks, and questionnaires for their interactive information retrieval studies. In this demonstration, Coagmento provides a solution to increase efficiency in the production of laboratory experiments for web search behavior.

However, since these usually have different core competencies --- building cyber-physical systems rather than e.g. machine learning or data mining algorithms --- delving into data science by domain experts such as system engineers or architects might be more cumbersome than expected. In order to help domain experts to delve into data science we designed the Semantic Snake Charmer (SSC), a domain knowledge-based search engine for Jupyter Notebooks. SSC is composed of three modules: (1) a human-machine cooperative module to identify internal documentation which contains the most relevant domain knowledge, (2) a natural language processing module capable of transforming relevant documentation into several semantic graph types, (3) a reinforcement-learning based search engine which learns, given user feedback, the best mapping between input queries and semantic graph type to rely on. We believe SSC can be a fundamental asset to allow the easy landing of data science in industrial domains.

In such settings, clustering search results can assist users to scan only a few coherent groups of related tweets rather than many individual tweets. However, in practice, the use of unsupervised clustering methods such as K -Means does not necessarily guarantee that the clusters themselves are relevant. Therefore, we develop a novel method of relevance-driven clustering for visual information retrieval to supply users with highly relevant clusters representing different information perspectives of their queries. We specifically propose a Visual Twitter Information Retrieval (Viz-TIR) tool for relevance-driven clustering and ranking of Twitter search results. At the heart of Viz-TIR is a fast greedy algorithm that optimizes an approximation of an expected F1-Score metric to generate these clusters. We demonstrate its effectiveness w.r.t. K -Means and a baseline method that shows all top matching results on a scenario related to searching natural disasters in US-based Twitter data spanning 2013 and 2014. Our demo shows that Viz-TIR is easy to use and more precise in extracting geo-temporally coherent clusters given search queries in comparison to K-Means, thus aiding the user in visually searching and browsing social network content. Overall, we believe this work enables new opportunities for the synthesis of information retrieval as well as combined relevance and display-aware optimization techniques to support query-adaptive visual information exploration interfaces.

In this paper, we introduced two computational measures of calculating the amount of surprise contained in a piece of text, and validated with the perceived surprise by users with different background knowledge expertise. We utilized a crowdsourcing approach and a lab-based user study to reach a large amount of users. The implication could be used to propose or refine future computational approaches to better predict human feeling of surprise triggered by reading a body of text.

However, the unassisted manual sensitivity review of born-digital documents is not practical due to, for example, the volume of documents that are created. Previous work has shown that sensitivity classification can be effective for predicting if a document contains sensitive information. However, since all of the released documents must be manually reviewed, it is important to know if sensitivity classification can assist sensitivity reviewers in making their sensitivity judgements. Hence, in this paper, we conduct a digital sensitivity review user study, to investigate if the accuracy of sensitivity classification effects the number of documents that a reviewer correctly judges to be sensitive or not (reviewer accuracy) and the time that it takes to sensitivity review a document (reviewing speed). Our results show that providing reviewers with sensitivity classification predictions, from a classifier that achieves 0.7 Balanced Accuracy, results in a 38% increase in mean reviewer accuracy and an increase of 72% in mean reviewing speeds, compared to when reviewers are not provided with predictions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that sensitivity classification is a viable technology for assisting with the sensitivity review of born-digital government documents.

A query with a false memory will match inadequate results or even no result, and an automatic query correction is necessary to satisfy the user expectations. For voice-based search interfaces, which aim at a natural, dialog-based search experience, a sensible answer to this kind of unintentionally ill-posed queries is even more crucial. However, the usual solutions in display-based interfaces for queries without matches (e.g., suggesting to drop some query terms) cannot really be transferred to the voice-based setting. Based on the assumption that false memory queries could be identified---a research problem in its own right---, we present the first user study on how voice-based search systems may communicate the respective corrections to a user. Our study compares the user satisfaction in a voice-based search setting for three kinds of false memory clarifications and a baseline case where the system just answers ""I don't know.'' Our findings suggest that (1)~users are more satisfied when they receive a clarification that and how the system corrected a false memory, (2)~users even prefer failed correction attempts over no such attempt, and (3)~the tone of the clarification has to be considered for the best possible user satisfaction as well.

In this paper we investigate the email triage behavior by presenting interview and survey results that characterize user behavior and needs. The results highlight current challenges and enhance our understanding of how the triage process can be more effectively supported.

Previous information systems studies have demonstrated that expectation disconfirmation can significantly affect a system user's behavior and experience. Inspired by this finding, we go beyond the traditional approach that focuses on the final post-search perception and study the expectation disconfirmation problem in Web search. Our study investigates task difficulty expectation disconfirmation and demonstrates that: (1) unexpectedly difficult task can significantly decrease a user's perceived level of search success and increase the perceived time pressure; (2) the size and direction of task difficulty expectation disconfirmation are significantly associated with Web search behavior; (3) it is possible to predict the state of expectation disconfirmation (especially the negative, unexpectedly difficult cases) based on search behavioral features. This study demonstrates the value of integrating expectation disconfirmation approach with interactive IR research and thus may encourage future researchers to further explore the effects of other aspects of users' expectations and post-search perceptions.

While there is a myriad of benefits, the existing literature suggests that many open government datasets lack accessibility and usability for diverse users. This study seeks to explore what contextual information users require when they access these datasets. Using mixed methods, we aim to discover the challenges of accessing data, and the necessary contextual information needed by the users to overcome these challenges. As the outcome of this study, we propose a framework called ""Data Guides"", which is composed of the identified important contextual information. In future work, we will test the effectiveness of the Data Guide in aiding users' accessing and understanding open government data.

Unfortunately, explicit negative relevance feedback is thought to have poor user experience. Instead, systems typically rely on implicit negative feedback. In this study, we confirm that, in the case of binary relevance feedback, users prefer giving positive feedback (and implicit negative feedback) over negative feedback (and implicit positive feedback). These two feedback mechanisms are functionally equivalent, capturing the same information from the user, but differ in how they are framed. Despite users' preference for positive feedback, there were no significant differences in behaviour. As users were not shown how feedback influenced search results, we hypothesise that previously reported results could, at least in part, be due to cognitive biases related to user perception of negative feedback.

There are many factors that might affect overall customer satisfaction with such services. We explore how adding language style to e-commerce chatbots can be used to increase user satisfaction, perceived product value, user interest in a product, and user engagement with a chatbot service. We conducted an experimental pilot study, where two chatbots were used to sell theatre tickets: one communicating in modern English and one in a Shakespearean-style dialect. 169 participants interacted with a randomly-assigned version of the chatbot. The results indicate that the bot talking in modern English showed a significantly higher user satisfaction, whereas the Shakespearean-styled chatbot showed higher user engagement and perceived product value. It was also found that the modern chatbot version was more often referred to as being 'easy to use', whereas the Shakespearean chatbot version was more often referred to as being 'fun to use'.

Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) was applied to investigate the types and outcomes of users' social-emotional interactions. Over 1,000 Stack Overflow postings were manually coded; Chi-square tests and logistic regressions were used for analysis. The study found that over half of the sample included IPA social-emotional acts. Interestingly, Disagrees , an act in IPA's negative social-emotional area, was the most frequently found category. Disagrees exhibited a significant negative relationship with the post-level outcome, post score, but a significant positive main effect and an interaction effect with a thread-level outcome, view count. The study identified two tension points: (1) potential benefits for the group of collaborative information seekers, at the slight expense of the individual who performed the negative social-emotional act; and (2) strains between the instrumental vs. social aspects of SQA. Research and practical implications of the findings were discussed.

The expectation is that the abstract provides a comprehensive summary of the article, enumerating key points for the reader to assess whether their information needs could be satisfied by reading the full-text. Furthermore, from a practical standpoint, obtaining the full-text is more complicated due to licensing issues, in the case of commercial publishers, and resource limitations of public repositories and pre-print servers. In this article, we use topic modelling to represent content in abstracts and full-text articles. Using Computer Science as a case study, we demonstrate that how well the abstract summarises the full-text is subfield-dependent. Indeed, we show that abstract representativeness has a direct impact on retrieval performance, with poorer abstracts leading to degraded performance. Finally, we present evidence that how well an abstract represents the full-text of an article is not random, but is a consequence of style and writing conventions in different subdisciplines and can be used to infer an ""evolutionary"" tree of subfields within Computer Science.

Social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) and information retrieval (IR) systems (e.g. Google), are now in the public spotlight to address these issues. Our research investigates an approach, known as Nudging, applied to the domain of IR, as a potential means to minimize impacts and threats surrounding both matters. We perform our study in the space of health search for two reasons. First, encounters with misinformation in this space have potentially grave outcomes. Second, there are many potential threats to personal privacy as a result of the data collected during a search task. Adopting methods and a corpus from previous work as the foundation, our study asked users to determine the effectiveness of a treatment for 10 medical conditions. Users performed the tasks on 4 variants of a search engine results page (SERP) and a control, with 3 of the SERP's being a Nudge (re-ranking, filtering and a visual cue) intended to reduce impacts to privacy with minimal impact to search result quality. The aim of our work is to determine the Nudge that is least impactful to good decision making while simultaneously increasing privacy protection. We find privacy impacts are significantly reduced for the re-ranking and filtering strategies, with no significant impacts on quality of decision making.

We investigated an approach for supporting searchers in their relevance decision in a digital library by automatically highlighting the most important keywords in abstracts. We conducted an eye-tracking study with 25 subjects and observed very different search and reading behavior which lead to diverse results. Some of the participants liked that highlighted abstracts accelerate their relevance decision, while others found that they disturb the reading flow. What many agree on is that the quality of highlighting is crucial for trust and system credibility.

However, evaluation and comparison of such systems requires a large number of such tasks, which are difficult to collect or make up. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a commonly used task set for evaluating struggling search of this kind. This paper proposes a convenient method to generate complex fact checking tasks. Each of the generated task has a clearly defined goal, which however takes an average searcher a significant amount of effort to reach. We conducted lab user studies to verify the feasibility of this method. The results confirmed its feasibility and efficiency.

Twenty-four participants performed two search tasks of varying complexity and completed a psychometric test to measure working memory ability. Our results found several important trends. First, task complexity had an effect on participants' perceptions about temporal demand and satisfaction with the time spent on the task. Second, participants with higher working memory exerted more search effort (e.g., issued more queries). Third, participants with higher working memory had better outcomes, particularly during more complex tasks. Finally, while participants with lower working memory exerted less effort (engaged in satisficing behaviors) and had weaker outcomes, working memory did not affect participants' post-task perceptions about workload and satisfaction. We discuss implications of our results for developing search tools to support users with varying levels of working memory.

Deleting photos appears to be difficult and the task of curation is often perceived as not enjoyable. The lack of curation can make it harder to retrieve photos when people need them for various reasons, such as individual reminiscing, shared remembering or self-presentation. In this study we investigate how we can stimulate people to organise their photo collections on their smartphones. Ten participants evaluated and qualitatively compared four applications with different characteristics regarding voting on and deleting photos. We found that voting on photos is easier and more enjoyable in comparison to deleting photos, that participants showed reminiscence while organising, that deleting can be frustrating, that participants have different preferences for sorting and viewing photos and that voting could make deleting and retrieving easier.

Web search logs provide large amounts of data about how people interact with ranked lists of documents, but very little is known about interaction with answer texts. In this paper, we use Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate three answer presentation and interaction approaches in a non-factoid question answering setting. We find that people perceive and react to good and bad answers very differently, and can identify good answers relatively quickly. Our results provide the basis for further investigation of effective answer interaction and feedback methods.

In this paper, we present a study of 9 lawyers conducting a simulated review of 50 contracts for five topics. We find that lawyers agree on the general location of relevant material at a higher rate than in other assessor agreement studies, but they do not entirely agree on the extent of the relevant material. Additionally, we do not find strong differences between lawyers who have differing levels of due diligence expertise. If we train machine learning models to identify these topics based on each user's judgments, the resulting models exhibit similar levels of agreement between each other as to the lawyers that trained them. This indicates that these models are learning the types of behaviour exhibited by their trainers, even if they are doing so imperfectly. Accordingly, we argue that additional work is necessary to improve the assessment process to ensure that all parties agree on identified material.

By reflecting on different conceptual models of sharing (two-actor vs three-actor model) and applying methods from social network analysis and text mining, we investigate the influence that different user interface features (retweeting and quote retweeting) have on politicians' sharing behaviour during an election campaign on the social media platform Twitter. Amongst other results, our analyses show that the two features are used quite differently with the quote RT feature promoting non-partisan interaction, which leads to a more civilized discourse with opponents and support for colleagues.

A variety of such models have been documented, some of which apply generally to a broad set of search settings, and others which are specific to settings such as academic search. Within the domain of academic search, it is unclear to what extent searchers employ the strategies specified in such models when faced with different types of information needs (ranging from fact verification to knowledge discovery). Using an online questionnaire that presented four different academic search scenarios, we collected data on the self-reported likelihood of researchers (professors, graduate students) to use specific strategies from each of five different information seeking models. Preliminary analysis of data from a pilot study (n=10) has revealed differences in which of the strategies are employed depending on the type of search scenario as well as the level of expertise of the searcher.

Automatic persona generation is the process of creating data-driven representations from user or customer statistics. Even though automatic persona generation is technically possible and provides advantages compared to manual persona creation regarding the speed and freshness of the personas, it is not clear (a) what information to include in the persona profiles and (b) how to display that information. To query into these aspects relating information design of personas, we conducted a user study with 38 participants. In the findings, we report several challenges relating to the design of automatically generated persona profiles, including usability issues, perceptual issues, and issues relating to information content. Our research has implications for the information design of data-driven personas.

This work presents a tool, HealthTranslator, available as a Google Chrome extension that intends to reduce this terminological gap while users are searching the Web for health information. HealthTranslator automatically annotates medical concepts in web documents, providing additional information, such as concept definition, related concepts and links to external references. The solution was evaluated regarding its: (a) performance - the document processing is done gradually, typically from the top to the bottom of the document and performance was not an issue raised by the users; (b) concept coverage - the solution was compared to a similar extension performing in English recognizing significantly more concepts. A comparison with a corpus of Portuguese documents manually annotated with medical concepts showed an average F-measure between 27% and 33%, depending on the type of concepts being recognized; (c) users' receptivity to HealthTranslator and its usability - many aspects were surveyed on a user study. In general, the extension has a good acceptance and users find it useful.

The agreement is higher for less hateful comments and lowest on moderately hateful comments. The results have implications for researchers developing machine learning models for online hate processing, as the extreme classes are likely to require fewer annotations for reaching statistical stability. Our findings suggest that the models developed in this domain should consider the distributions of hate ratings rather than average hate scores.

Performing systematic reviews, however, can involve repetitive and laborious work in order to reach reliable standards. Strict guidelines and availability of published reviews make the task amenable to computerised assistance and automation using text mining, information extraction, and machine learning techniques. However, it is unclear which aspects of this Work Task are best suited for such support. This paper describes a three-month ethnographic study and CognitiveWork Analysis of the systematic reviews performed by a medical research group. Our findings show that the IR aspects of systematic reviews involve many tasks at two separate levels: 1) taxonomic organisation of documents and sub-document elements in relation to topic queries and domain-specific resources, and 2) extraction methods for structured summaries from the classified resources. This provides the basis for future work designing search tools with localised optimization and subtask automation to support specific phases of the process.

Difficulties arise in query formulation but also in understanding the retrieved documents. In this work we analyze how documents' readability affects users' comprehension and how both affect the retrieval performance, measured in different ways. In addition, we analyze how performance measures relate with each other. For this purpose we have conducted a laboratory user study with 40 participants. We found that readability is essential for a document to be at least partially relevant and that it becomes even more important if the document has medico-scientific terminology. Moreover, the relevance of a document to a specific user highly depends on its comprehension. In lay queries we found the medical accuracy of users' answers is related to the session's relevance assessments. This shows that users can, at least in part, relate their relevance assessments with the medical accuracy of the documents. On the other hand, this relationship does not exist with medico-scientific queries.

Various click models have been developed to decode users' search behavior and to extract useful knowledge from query logs. Although the state-of-the-art neural click models have been shown to be very effective in click modeling, the input representations of queries and documents rely on either manually crafted features or on automatic methods suffering from the high-dimensionality issue. Moreover, these neural click models are still rather restrictive when coping with commonly biased user clicks. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively deploy a neural network model for decoding users' click behavior. First, we present two novel rank-biased neural network models ($RBNN$ and $RBNN^* $) for click modeling. The key idea is to deploy different weight matrices across different rank positions. Second, we introduce a new method ($QD\mymathhyphen DCCA$) for automatically learning the vector representations for both queries and documents within the same low-dimensional space, which provides high-quality inputs for $RBNN$ and $RBNN^* $. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on two different real query logs to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed neural click models. The experiments demonstrate that: (1) The proposed models can achieve substantially improved performance over the state-of-the-art baseline on two datasets across multiple metrics. By incorporating rank-specific weight matrices, $RBNN$ and $RBNN^* $ are more capable of dealing with the position-bias problem. (2) The input representations of queries, documents and context information significantly affect the performance of neural click models. Thanks to the application of $QD\mymathhyphen DCCA$, not only $RBNN$ and $RBNN^* $ but also the baseline method exhibit enhanced performance. Furthermore, the training cost under the proposed models is greatly reduced.

Unfortunately, social media posts may not always provide accurate or meaningful descriptions of the contents of the embedded images, making searching for images a challenging task. In this research, we augment the textual contents of the posts with new information extracted from the images using image processing and deep learning methods, and provide a visual interface to enable interactive image retrieval. A user study was conducted with 28 participants to collect evidence on how our approach was used in relation to Vakkari's three-stage model of information seeking. We also analyzed participants' perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction in comparison to a common grid-based image search interface. The results from this study highlight the value of providing visual and interactive features to enable searchers to discover images from social media sources.

However, little prior work has explored how people use search engines and information resources as part of their creative processes, and how systems might better support users working on creative tasks. In this paper, we conducted an online survey with 175 participants to explore how people use search engines and online resources (e.g., images, videos, and social media) to support their creative tasks. Our participants reported information seeking to support a broad range of everyday creativity including tasks in arts, writing, crafts, and technical projects. Our findings show that participants' tasks included multiple stages of creative processes (e.g., creating ideas, combining ideas, executing plans) and that participants reported using search engines along with other tools (such as images and videos) to facilitate their creative process. By using Bayesian random effects regression models, we found that different stages of the creative process influence participants' use of tools. For example, for tasks that involved creating ideas, participants were more likely to use images and social sites, and when needing to put ideas into practice they were more likely to use videos. We also found differences in users' satisfaction with using the tools for different creative stages. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for supporting users' information seeking needs during creative tasks.

Smart phones are rapidly becoming our main method of accessing information and are frequently used to perform ""on-the-go'' search tasks. As research into information retrieval continues to evolve, evaluating search behaviour in context is relatively new. Previous research has studied the effects of context through either self-reported diary studies or quantitative log analysis; however, neither approach is able to accurately capture context of use at the time of searching. In this study, we aim to gain a better understanding of task relevance and search behaviour via a task-based user study (n=31) employing a bespoke Android app. The app allowed us to accurately capture the user's context when completing tasks at different times of the day over the period of a week. Through analysis of the collected data, we gain a better understanding of how using smart phones on the go impacts search behaviour, search performance and task relevance and whether or not the actual context is an important factor.

Understanding the relationship between activities, time, location, and other contextual features can improve the quality of various intelligent systems, including contextual search engines, task managers, digital personal assistants, chat bots, and recommender systems. In this work, we propose a method for extraction of an extensive set of open-vocabulary activities from social media. In particular, we derive tens of thousands of ongoing activities from Twitter, where people share information about their past, present, and future events and, using attached metadata, we establish spatiotemporal models of these activities at the time of posting. While public Twitter content is subject to self-censorship (not all activities are tweeted about), we compare extracted data with unbiased survey data (ATUS) and show evidence that for activities which are tweeted about, the underlying spatiotemporal profiles correctly capture their real distributions of activity conditioned on time and location. Next, to better understand the set of activities present in this dataset (and what role self-censorship may play), we perform a qualitative analysis to understand the activities, locations, and their temporal properties. Finally, we go on to solve predictive tasks centered on the relationship between activity and spatiotemporal context that are aimed at supporting an individual's information needs. Our predictive models, which incorporate text, personal history and temporal features, show a significant performance gain over a strong frequency-based baseline.

While the behavioral effects of task features have been thoroughly discussed in a large body of literature, how different information seeking intentions in query segments serve as bridges between task and Web search behavior still remains unexplored. To develop a more comprehensive, multi-level (i.e., task level, intention level, and behavior level) understanding of Web search, the authors analyzed intention and search behavior data collected from 693 query segments generated by 40 participants in a controlled lab setting, seeking to answer two main research questions: 1) from task to intention : how do different task features affect users' information seeking intentions at different stages of a search session? 2) from intention to behavior : How is a user's search behavior associated with their information seeking intentions in the current and next query segments respectively? The results demonstrate that: 1) Task features significantly affected the frequency of occurrence of most of the information seeking intentions, and these effects gradually faded away as search sessions proceeded; 2) The presences of a variety of intentions in both current and subsequent query segments were connected with and detectable by different subsets of behavioral measures. This study contributes to the understanding of the connections between task, intentions in query segments, and search behavior, and thereby has implications for designing system affordances for supporting different intentions and search activities in various task stages and contexts.

The aim of this study is to identify user interests in different parts of an online collection and investigate the related search behavior. To do this, we propose to use the metadata of selected facets and clicked documents as features for clustering sessions identified in user logs. We evaluate the session clusters by measuring their stability over a six-month period. We apply our approach to data from the National Library of the Netherlands, a typical digital library with a richly annotated historical newspaper collection and a faceted search interface. Our results show that users interested in specific parts of the collection use different search techniques. We demonstrate that a metadata-based clustering helps to reveal and understand user interests in terms of the collection, and how search behavior is related to specific parts within the collection.

Consequently, there may be a tension between what the community regards as being a rigorous methodology against what researchers can do ethically with their users. This paper discusses issues to consider when designing IIR studies involving people with dyslexia, such as sampling, informed consent and data collection. The conclusion is that conducting user studies on participants with dyslexia requires special considerations at all stages of the experimental design. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness and understanding in the research community about experimental methods involving users with dyslexia, and addresses researchers, as well as editors and reviewers. Several of the issues raised do not only apply to people with dyslexia, but have implications when researching other groups, for instance elderly people and users with learning, cognitive, sensory or motor impairments.

Detection of regional webpages containing meetings and extraction of day, time, and address of meetings from those pages are essential steps in making the information available and up-to-date in a global meeting list. However, varied structure of the webpages and the meetings pose challenges in achieving the goal with traditional information retrieval methods. In this paper we propose HAIR: a semi-automated human-aided information retrieval technique and explore its potential to solve this problem. We describe future directions in developing this critical tool and discuss major implications of our work in pointing to the importance of context-specific rather than context-agnostic semi-automated in-formation retrieval techniques by conceptualizing the proposed methods and results in a broader context.

The data is used to analyze gaze behavior or to identify Areas of Interest (AOI) the user has looked at. So far, tools for analyzing eye tracking data have certain limitations in supporting the analysis of gaze behavior in IIR experiments. Experiments often consist of a huge number of different visited web pages. In existing analysis tools the data can only be analyzed in videos or images and AOIs for every single web page have to be specified by hand, in a very time consuming process. In this work, we propose the reading protocol software which breaks eye tracking data down to the textual level by considering the HTML structure of the web pages. This has a lot of advantages for the analyst. First and foremost, it can easily be identified on a large scale what has actually been viewed and read on the stimuli pages by the subjects. Second, the web page structure can be used to filter to AOIs. Third, gaze data of multiple users can be presented on the same page, and fourth, fixation times on text can be exported and further processed in other tools. We present the software, its validation, and example use cases with data from three existing IIR experiments.

We conducted a user study where 30 participants performed searches on the web. We measured their verbal knowledge before and after each task in a content-independent manner, by assessing the semantic similarity of their entries to expert vocabulary. We hypothesize that differences in verbal knowledge-change of participants are reflected in their search behaviors and eye-gaze measures related to acquiring information and reading. Our results show that participants with higher change in verbal knowledge differ by reading significantly less, and entering more sophisticated queries, compared to those with lower change in knowledge. However, we do not find significant differences in other search interactions like page visits, and number of queries.

We argue that enriching the knowledge-context in SERPs has great potential for facilitating human learning, critical thinking, and creativity by expanding searchers' information-literate actions such as comparing, evaluating, and differentiating between information sources. Thus it supports the development of learning-centric search systems. Using theories and empirical findings from psychology and the learning sciences, we first discuss general effects of Web search on memory and learning. After reviewing selected research addressing metacognition and self-regulated learning, we discuss design goals for search systems that support metacognitive skills required for long-term learning, creativity, and critical thinking. We then propose that SERPs make both bibliographic and inferential knowledge-context readily accessible to motivate and facilitate information-literate actions for learning and creative endeavors. A brief discussion of related ideas, designs, and prototypes found in prior work follows. We conclude the paper by presenting future research directions and questions on knowledge-context, information-literate actions, and learning-centric search systems.

Specific locations are often associated with searches on particular topics, and individual users perform different tasks in habituated places. A classic example of habituated space is the commuter who regularly reads the news on the train. This paper investigates these associations through four user studies that examine different uses of place in information interaction. Through this, we reveal the ways in which the location of information interactions makes them effective or ineffective. This extends our interpretation of the role of place in information interaction beyond established foci such as location-based search.

The study was based on TBII framework [20]. The research was conducted in real-life setting using interview and shadowing. The following task process types were identified: (i) searching secondary sources, (ii) reading and making notes, (iii) collecting and processing data, (iv) analyzing and (v) writing. We found that IR interfaces were not always optimal for historians' use, and that the interfaces should support the expression of information needs better. The data processing consumes a lot of historians' time and they could benefit from designing better tools. We also found out that task process types have an effect on how digital tools or data are being used. Therefore, the context in which the tool or data is being used, should be taken into account when designing tools for historians.

However, they are not capable of handling complicated information-seeking tasks that involve multiple turns of information exchange. Due to the limited communication bandwidth in conversational search, it is important for conversational assistants to accurately detect and predict user intent in information-seeking conversations. In this paper, we investigate two aspects of user intent prediction in an information-seeking setting. First, we extract features based on the content, structural, and sentiment characteristics of a given utterance, and use classic machine learning methods to perform user intent prediction. We then conduct an in-depth feature importance analysis to identify key features in this prediction task. We find that structural features contribute most to the prediction performance. Given this finding, we construct neural classifiers to incorporate context information and achieve better performance without feature engineering. Our findings can provide insights into the important factors and effective methods of user intent prediction in information-seeking conversations.

In this paper, we study the use of searchbots (i.e., bots that perform specific types of searches) during collaborative information-seeking tasks mediated through Slack. We report on a user study in which 27 pairs of participants were exposed to three searchbot conditions (a within-subjects design). In the first condition, participants completed the task by searching independently and coordinating through Slack (no searchbot). In the second condition, participants could only search inside of Slack using the searchbot. In the third condition, participants could both search inside of Slack using the searchbot and outside of Slack using their own independent search interfaces. We investigate four research questions focusing on the influence of the searchbot condition on outcomes associated with: (RQ1) participants' levels of workload, (RQ2) collaborative awareness, (RQ3) experiences interacting with the searchbot, and (RQ4) search behaviors. Our results suggest opportunities and challenges in designing searchbots to support collaborative search. On one hand, access to the searchbot resulted in more collaborative awareness, ease of coordination, and fewer duplicated searches. On the other hand, forcing participants to share the querying environment resulted in fewer overall queries, fewer query refinements by individuals, and greater levels of effort. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing effective searchbots to support collaborative search.

The role of these assistants is evolving to also support people engaged in work tasks, in workplaces and beyond. To design truly useful intelligent assistants for work, it is important to better understand the work tasks that people are performing. Based on a survey of 401 respondents' daily tasks and activities in a work setting, we present a classification of work-related tasks, and analyze their key characteristics, including the frequency of their self-reported tasks, the environment in which they undertake the tasks, and which, if any, electronic devices are used. We also investigate the cyber, physical, and social aspects of tasks. Finally, we reflect on how intelligent assistants could influence and help people in a work environment to complete their tasks, and synthesize our findings to provide insight on the future of intelligent assistants in support of amplifying personal productivity.

Those functionalities include summarization, ranking, filtering and query. The goal is to support users looking for, collecting, and synthesizing information. The system is also easily extendable, allowing for customized functionality for users during information sessions and researchers studying higher levels of abstraction for information retrieval. The demo shows the front end interactions using a browser plug-in that offers new interactions with documents during search sessions, as well as the back-end components driving the system.

An individual»s wellbeing is also affected by the communication with their physician, as the use of technical terminology may hinder the patient»s understanding. A patient»s ability to, later on, recall or retrieve helpful information could reduce these comprehension problems and this can be improved by a good management of personal health information. To help overcome some of these problems, we created HealthTalks, a mobile app that empowers the patients, easing their daily health tasks and self-care ability. It does so by recording the audio of a medical appointment, transcribing its dialogue, giving more information about medical concepts employed, and allowing information associated with medical appointments to be easily managed by the patient. Usability tests were conducted with elderly people, ranging from the icons used to the general user experience. Results were very positive, with users accomplishing most tasks successfully and often with the least amount of clicks. We also evaluated the speech recognition software used, Google Cloud Speech API, reaching an error rate of 12 percent in medical texts.

An automated system is quick, consistent, and has full coverage over the study material. A system allows an analyst to analyze more answers in a given time period; provides the same initial results regardless of who does the analysis, reducing the risks of inter-rater discrepancy; and does not risk miss responses due to fatige or boredom. These factors reduce the cost and increase the reliability of the service. The most important feature, however, is relieving the human analyst from the frustrating aspects of the coding task, freeing the effort to the central challenge of understanding themes. Gavagai Explorer is available on-line.

This question has as many answers as there are people, which may vary by time of day, and the activity of the listener. We envision a contextual music search and recommendation system, which could suggest appropriate music to the user in the current context. As an important step in this direction, we set out to understand what are the users» intents for listening to music, and how they relate to common daily activities. To accomplish this, we conduct and analyze a survey of why and when people of different ages and in different countries listen to music. The resulting categories of common musical intents, and the associations of intents and activities, could be helpful for guiding the development and evaluation of contextual music recommendation systems.

Traditionally, judgments have been gathered via desktop interfaces. However, with the rise in popularity of smaller devices for information access, it has become imperative to investigate whether desktop based judgments are different from mobile judgments. Recently, user effort and document usefulness have also emerged as important dimensions to optimize and evaluate information retrieval systems. Since existing work is limited to desktops, it remains to be seen how these judgments are affected by user»s search device. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by collecting and analyzing relevance, usefulness and effort judgments on mobiles and desktops. Analysis of these judgments shows high agreement rate between desktop and mobile judges for relevance, followed by usefulness and findability. We also found that desktop judges are likely to spend more time and examine non-relevant/not-useful/difficult documents in greater depth compared to mobile judges. Based on our findings, we suggest that relevance judgments should be gathered via desktops and effort judgments should be collected on each device independently.

The effectiveness is mostly reached through inherent displays» properties - large display real estate and high resolution - that allow for visualization of complex datasets, and support of group work and embodied interaction. To raise users» efficiency, however, more sophisticated user support in the form of advanced user interfaces might be needed. For that we need profound understanding of how large, tiled displays impact users work and behavior. We need to extract behavioral patterns for different tasks and data types. This paper reports on study results of how users, while working collaboratively, process spatially fixed items on large, tiled displays. The results revealed a recurrent pattern showing that users prefer to process documents column wise rather than row wise or erratic.

CNER is similar in spirit to List Question answering and Entity disambiguation. However, the main focus of CNER is to obtain user feedback for constructing a profile for a class of entities on the fly and use that to retrieve entities from free text. Given a sentence, and an entity selected from that sentence, CNER aims to retrieve sentences that have entities similar to query entity. This paper explores obtaining term relevance feedback and importance weighting from humans in order to improve a CNER system. We report our findings based on the efforts of IR researchers as well as crowdsourced workers.

However, at most times users consider factors such as ease, time taken to complete the task, and the number of sources to be consulted as the essential factors while fulfilling the information seeking task. In our study, we explore the role of different cost variables -- ease, time taken to complete the task, and the number of sources consulted -- as the factors to be explored based on different cognitive task complexity levels, from Bloom»s taxonomy, by conducting a user study. We study the different search behaviors shown by users in online and offline environments based on the different cognitive task complexity levels and the three cost variables. We observed intriguing results that show factors such as ease, time, and the number of sources play a role in source selection while completing the tasks. Our study is a novel proposition in that we explore research in the direction of source selection based on different cognitive task complexity levels. The findings will contribute to shaping how tasks should be designed to use sources in a helpful and convenient manner. Moreover, the results also advance our understanding of the role that different affordances play in online and offline search behavior.

The search process is interactive and typically requires entering one or more queries, and assessing both summaries from Search Engine Result Pages and the underlying documents, to ultimately satisfy some information need. Under the Search Economic Theory model of interactive information retrieval, differences in query costs will result in search behavior changes. We investigate how differences in query inputs themselves may relate to Search Economic Theory by conducting a lab-based experiment to observe how text entries influence subsequent search interactions. Our results indicate that for faster typing speeds, more queries are entered in a session, while both query lengths and assessment times are lower.

Previous literature has shown relationships between Web browsing behavior and person»s corresponding search task. We find statistically significant browser features for detecting task - comparing the features to previous literature - and apply this knowledge to task classification of search sessions. Even though significant features improve prediction over baselines, it is not by much. We suggest that a more subtle treatment of such features should go beyond statistical significance. In some cases, considering personal patterns may be required for effective prediction.

To address this problem, we introduce a two-stage examination model that can separately capture the position bias with a skimming model and the attractiveness bias with an attractiveness model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by using a dataset that contains explicit examination feedbacks from users. We further investigate user»s examination behaviors by analyzing the model parameters learned via EM algorithm. The results reveal some interesting findings such as how the skimming behavior is dependent on the previous examination sequence and what factors are associated with the attractiveness of search results on mobile SERPs.

But given the flexibility provided by the social media platforms, it is important to ensure that the right kind of information is delivered to the right audience when needed. The pilot study presented in this paper considered a sample of Zika related tweets that were classified into different prevention techniques. The classification categories were drawn from the guidelines by CDC. Training a logistic regression model on the annotated data we found the accuracy to be 72%. The findings are significant in studying the effectiveness of social media platforms in spreading the right kind of information in time. This in turn can be useful in informing health care officials to take necessary steps with the help of real-time communication for such unfortunate events in future.

We conducted a study of Amazon Alexa usage and explored the manifestations and possible correlates of users' personification of Alexa. The data were collected via diary instrument from nineteen Alexa users over four days. Less than half of the participants reported personification behaviors. Most of the personification reports can be characterized as mindless politeness (saying 'thank you' and 'please' to Alexa). Two participants expressed deeper personification by confessing their love and reprimanding Alexa. A new study is underway to understand whether expressions of personifications are caused by users' emotional attachments or skepticism about technology's intelligence.

This study aims to fill this gap by researching the relationships between time constraints, search behaviors, and usefulness judgments. A controlled lab experiment was conducted with 40 participants searching for four tasks of two types (fact finding and information understanding), under two time conditions (with or without time constraints). Results show that time constraints and usefulness had interaction effects on first dwell time; while usefulness had positive relationship with total dwell time. Results indicate that knowing time constraints helps predict document usefulness from dwell time. The findings provide implications on personalization in information search.

In this study, we conducted a user experiment to assess searchers learning outcomes and examine how information source selection strategies would influence their learning outcomes. In this experiment, thirty-two college students conducted search for two types of learning tasks: receptive tasks and critical tasks. Participants were asked to write down what they knew about the task before and after the search. For data analysis, we proposed a comprehensive assessment method, which used both quantitative measures (i.e. knowledge points, knowledge facets, knowledge scope, etc.) and qualitative measures to assess users' learning outcomes. Our results demonstrated that searchers' information source preferences influence their learning outcomes; i.e., encyclopedia-preferred sessions had better relevance of written summaries in receptive tasks and Q&A preferred sessions led to better relevance in critical tasks. Furthermore, searchers had two types of information source selection strategies: task-adaptive strategy and non-task-adaptive strategy. The results showed that searchers with task-adaptive strategy could gain better learning outcomes, e.g. knowledge points, facets, scope, depth, relevance and analyticity. This study highlighted the importance of information source selection strategies in learning-related type of tasks, and knowing how to select suitable information sources for different types of tasks may benefit the learning outcome for searchers.

While this everyday information behavior has become a common mode of human information behavior, little is known about the factors that constitute such practices to inform the design of information dashboards. Drawing from 729 user reviews of indoor air quality monitoring stations posted to Amazon.com as a case, this study investigates the process through which people gather and use information from an ambient display as everyday information behavior. By using sense-making theory as an analytical framework, we illustrate key themes that constitute ways in which people make sense of information through everyday information behaviors of ambient display use.

We interviewed eight early career researchers (ECRs) composed of doctoral students or recent graduates about their overall scholarly workflows including not only search but also social networking around scholarly information and production of scholarly works. Evidence suggests that search itself is less discrete and library-centric than prior models may have suggested, and that students use both social resources and non-library technologies to discover and locate scholarly works. We argue that taking a workflow-centric and collaboration-centric view, rather than a search-centric view, should inform design of tools and training for search of scholarly resources.

Research suggests that walking has negative effects on search performance and behaviour and that auditory distractions can impact on user input and affect perception of task duration. In this work we conduct a user study (n=16) using a simulated distracting condition to investigate how auditory distractions change perceived and objective search performance and behaviour. Our results suggest that noisy environments induce stress on users, causing them to feel additional perceived time pressure, leading to a reduced ability to identify task-relevant documents and a compulsion to finish the search task quickly.

In this study, we examine active viewing behaviors, specifically seeking and highlighting within videos, which may suggest greater levels of participation and learning. We deployed a system designed for active viewing to an undergraduate class for a semester. The analysis of online activity traces and interview data provided novel findings on video highlighting behavior in educational contexts.

Participants were asked to retrospectively think aloud while viewing screen recordings of one of their search tasks. Qualitative, inductive coding was applied to transcribed interviews. An early theme about government websites and information emerged in the data analysis and that is the topic of this paper. For all three tasks, participants prioritized and valued information from U.S. government websites over that of commercial websites, which seems to contradict recent national surveys indicating low levels of trust in government information sources and the government in general. Our findings suggest that for certain topics, especially those associated with high levels of uncertainty, people might resort to more basic search and evaluation behaviors.

A desirable trait of such applications is a sense of humor. It is, therefore, important to be able to measure quality of humorous responses. However, humor evaluation is hard since humor is highly subjective. To address this problem, we conducted an online evaluation of 30 dialog jokes from different sources by almost 300 participants -- volunteers and Mechanical Turk workers. We collected joke ratings along with participants» age, gender, and language proficiency. Results show that demographics and joke topics can partly explain variation in humor judgments. We expect that these insights will aid humor evaluation and interpretation. The findings can also be of interest for humor generation methods in conversational systems.

In particular, in the fields of cross-language and multilingual search, the majority of research has focused primarily on improving retrieval and translation accuracy, while paying comparably less attention to multilingual user interaction aspects. By contrast, this paper specifically focuses on multilingual search user interface preferences and behaviors, through a lab-based user study involving 25 participants interacting with a set of four different interactive multilingual search user interfaces. User preference results confirm that multilingual search users generally have strong preferences towards interfaces that provide clear language separation, and that the traditional approach of interleaving results, as typically used in prior research, is least preferred. In addition, an analysis of user interaction behaviors shows that multilingual users make significant use of each of their languages, and that there are several interaction behavior differences depending on interface and task type.

Few studies have examined how multilingual web users seek information in two or more languages online, specifically how they switch languages in order to get satisfying search results. This research investigates native Chinese web users» code-switching (Chinese-English) search behaviors in their information seeking process through diary studies interviews. Results indicate that they usually switch languages when they need translation, search for domain knowledge, news and entertainment information, and academic resources, go online shopping, seek personal health information, and need social networking. Findings highlight when the participants need prompt information, they search in Chinese in order to get an immediate understanding. They seek information in English for better resources, which can offer them appropriate information and help them search effectively. We also find that these multilingual users use situational code-switching when the search tasks require them to switch languages in order to get effective and sufficient search results. The role of each language is different in the situational code-switching. When web users switch languages due to emotional or attitude changes associated with complex social or cultural context, they use metaphorical code-switching in order to get satisfying search results. The study aims to provide implications for website design concerning multilingual web users' code-switching search strategies, habits, and needs.

Towards this goal, we explore document representations for retrieval that include features associated with effective learning outcomes. While prior studies have investigated different retrieval models designed for teaching, this study is the first to investigate how document-level features are associated with actual learning outcomes when users get results from a personalized learning-oriented retrieval algorithm. We also conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first crowdsourced longitudinal study of long-term learning retention, in which we gave a subset of users who participated in an initial learning and assessment study a delayed post-test approximately nine months later. With this data, we were able to analyze how the three retrieval conditions in the original study were associated with changes in long-term vocabulary knowledge. We found that while users who read the documents in the personalized retrieval condition had immediate learning gains comparable to the other two conditions, they had better long-term retention of more difficult vocabulary.

In many cases, users immediately requery without clicking on any search results. In this paper, we report on a user study designed to investigate the rate at which users immediately reformulate at different levels of search quality. We had users search for answers to questions as we manipulated the placement of the only relevant document in a ranked list of search results. We show that as the quality of search results decreases, the probability of immediately requerying increases. We find that users can quickly decide to immediately reformulate, and the time to immediately reformulate appears to be independent of the quality of the search results. Finally, we show that there appears to be two types of users. One group has a high probability of immediately reformulating and the other is unlikely to immediately reformulate unless no relevant documents can be found in the search results. While requerying takes time, it is the group of users who are more likely to immediately requery that are able to able find answers to questions the fastest.

We believe that technical advances in Augmented Reality will allow Information Retrieval to go even further, making use of both the users» surroundings and their abilities to interact with the physical world. In this paper, we present the fundamental concept of Reality-Based Information Retrieval, which combines the classic Information Retrieval process with Augmented Reality technologies to provide context-dependent search cues and situated visualizations of the query and the results. With information needs often stemming from real-world experiences, this novel combination has the potential to better support both Just-in-time Information Retrieval and serendipity. Based on extensive literature research, we propose a conceptual framework for Reality-Based Information Retrieval. We illustrate and discuss this framework and present two prototypical implementations, which we tested in small user studies. They demonstrate the feasibility of our concepts and inspired our discussion of notable challenges for further research in this novel and promising area.

One of the most popular productivity software suites, Microsoft Office, has recently developed functionality that allows users to issue free-form text queries to a search system to quickly find commands they want to execute, retrieve help documentation or access web results in a unified interface. In this paper, we analyze millions of search sessions originating from within Microsoft Office applications, collected over one month of activity, in an effort to characterize search behavior in productivity software. Our research brings together previous efforts in analyzing command usage in large-scale applications and efforts in understanding search behavior in environments other than the web. Our findings show that users engage primarily in command search, and that re-accessing commands through search is a frequent behavior. Our work represents the first large-scale analysis of search over command spaces and is an important first step in understanding how search systems integrated with productivity software can be successfully developed.

Recently, there has been a lot of attention on processing the content of meetings for later reuse, such as reviewing a meeting for supporting failing memories, keeping in mind key issues, verification, etc. That is due to the fact that meetings are essential for sharing knowledge in organizations. In this paper, we propose four novel time-series methods for predicting the topics that one should review in preparation for a next meeting. The predicted/recommended topics can be reviewed by a user as a memory augmentation process to facilitate recall of key points of a previous meeting. With the growing number of meetings at an organization that one may attend weekly and with the growing number of topics discussed, forgetting past meetings becomes eminent, hence recommending certain topics to the user in order to prepare the user for a future meeting is beneficial and important. Our experimental results on real-world data, demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform a state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model baseline. This indicates the efficacy of our proposed methods for modeling semantics in temporal data.

The few existing studies have typically used interview or survey methods to focus on personal information management (PIM) practices on smartphones. We present the results of an exploratory contextual inquiry study of PIM practices aimed at providing a structured, naturalistic overview of PIM on both smartphones and tablets. We find that people use multiple complementary strategies to acquire different types of information on their devices, and that people rely strongly on automatic chronological ordering instead of organization by subject, although this pays off most for smaller information collections. Deletion of information is strongly influenced by usefulness and personal attachment. Finally, we find that people strongly prefer browsing over search when retrieving information from their devices.

Despite being designed for real-time and ephemeral content, recent studies have shown that re-finding of older content is performed in Social Media applications too. To better understand why this is and how re-finding can be better supported, in this work we describe the results of a large-scale web-based survey which queried 606 Twitter users on how and how often they re-find, as well as the motivations for this behaviour. Our main contribution is the qualitative analysis of these motivations and motivations sourced via two existing studies, resulting in a coding scheme documenting the breadth and frequency of different Social Media re-finding tasks. We discuss how this classification can be used in (i) the design of task-based evaluations, (ii) the detection and interpretation of re-finding in click-stream data and (iii) the design of Social Media search systems.

To better understand email management practices in detail, we examine the distribution of visits to emails over time. During their lifetime, emails may be visited one or more times, and with each visit different actions may be taken. Emails that are revisited over time are especially interesting because they represent an opportunity to improve email management and search. In this paper, we present a large-scale log analysis of email revisitation, the activities that people perform on revisited email messages (e.g. responding to, organizing or deleting messages, and opening attachments), and the strategies they use to go back to these emails. We find that most emails have a short lifetime, with more than 33% having a lifetime of less than 5 minutes. We also find that deleting is the most common action taken on messages visited once, and that responding and organizing are more common for messages visited more than once. We complement the log analysis with a survey to understand the motivation behind revisits and the types of emails that are revisited. The survey results show that 73% of the visits are to find information (e.g. a link or document, instructions to perform a task, or answers to questions), while 20% of revisits are to respond to the email. Our findings have implications for designing email clients and intelligent agents that support both short- and long-term revisitation patterns.

We were interested in confusion engendered by the treatments on the participants, and conducted a within-subjects study in the actual work environment, using eye-tracking and talk-aloud data collection. We coded the verbal data into classes of informativeness and confusion and correlated it with fixations and durations on the Areas of Interests recorded by the eye-tracking device. We used various analysis techniques, including Mann-Whitney, regression, and Levenshtein distance, to investigate how confused users differed from non-confused users, what information of the personas caused confusion, and what were the predictors of confusion of end users of personas. We consolidate our various findings into a confusion ratio measure, which highlights in a succinct manner the most confusing elements of the personas. Findings show that inconsistencies among the informational elements of the persona generate the most confusion, especially with the elements of images and social media quotes. The research has implications for the design of personas and related information products, such as user profiling and customer segmentation.

The resulting information organization structures mitigate some of the challenges of searching digital information realms; however, the topic hierarchies are often large and complex, and thus difficult to navigate. Automated techniques have been shown to produce significantly smaller, simplified versions of existing topic hierarchies while preserving access to the majority of the collection, but these simplified topic hierarchies have never been tested with human participants, and so it is not clear what effect simplification would have on the exploration and use of such structures for browsing and retrieval. This study partly addresses this gap by performing a comparative test with three groups of university students (N=62) performing ten topic hierarchy exploration tasks using one of three versions of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) hierarchy: 1) the original LCSH hierarchy, acting as a baseline, 2) a shallower version of 1), and 3) a narrower version of 2). A quantitative analysis of measures of accuracy, time, and browsing shows that participants using the simplified trees were significantly more accurate and faster than those using the unmodified tree, and the narrower, balanced tree was also faster than the shallower tree. These results show that automated topic hierarchy simplification can facilitate the use of such hierarchies, which has implications for the development of information organization theory and human-information interaction techniques for similar information structures.

This study analyzed the data collected from participants» self-reported information seeking experiences in online logbooks and follow-up semi-structured interviews with 23 participants by applying both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings suggest that task type and information source type affect individuals» information quality judgment, and they perceive websites are more accurate than interpersonal sources, though the latter can be trustworthy. Moreover, their understanding of the type of information also affects their quality judgment. For example, they prefer factual information to opinions in some situations.

For example, related work in this area has investigated how this behavior can be measured and applied to distinguish between easy and difficult tasks. In this work, we look at the searcher's behavior in the domain of journalism for four different task types, and additionally, for two different topics in each task type. Search behavior is measured with a number of session variables and correlated to subjective measures such as task difficulty, task success and the usefulness of documents. We acknowledge prior results in this area that task difficulty is correlated to user effort and that easy and difficult tasks are distinguishable by session variables. However, in this work, we emphasize the role of the task topic - in and of itself - over parameters such as the search results and read content pages, dwell times, session variables and subjective measures such as task difficulty or task success. With this knowledge researchers should give more attention to the task topic as an important influence factor for user behavior.

Many times this results from a lack of clarity about the task at hand, or the way an information or search system works. In addition, people may not know what they do not know. The former is addressed by search systems by providing recommendations, whereas there are no good solutions for the latter problem. Even when a search system makes recommendations, they are limited to suggesting objects such as queries and documents only. They do not consider providing suggestions for strategies, people, or processes. This Perspective Paper addresses it by showing how to investigate the nature of the work a person is doing, predicting the potential problems they may encounter, and providing help to overcome those problems. This help could be an object such as a document or a query, a strategy, or a person. This whole process is referred to as Information Fostering. Beyond crafting a general-purpose recommender system, Information Fostering is the idea of providing proactive suggestions and help to information seekers. This could allow them avoid potential problems and capture promising opportunities from a search process before it is too late. The current paper presents this new perspective by outlining desired characteristics of an Information Fostering system, envisioning application scenarios, and proposing a set of potential methods for moving forward. Beyond these details, the primary purpose of this paper is to offer a new viewpoint that looks at the other side of the information seeking coin, by bringing together ideas from human-computer interaction, information retrieval, recommender systems, and education.

We present a Wizard of Oz study on the use of searchbots (i.e., chatbots that perform specific types of searches) during collaborative information-seeking tasks. Specifically, we study searchbots that intervene dynamically and compare between two intervention types: (1) the searchbot presents questions to users to gather the information it needs to produce results, and (2) the searchbot monitors the conversation among the collaborators, infers the necessary information, and then displays search results with no additional input from the users. We investigate three research questions: (RQ1) What is the effect of a searchbot (and its intervention type) on participants» collaborative experience' (RQ2) What is the effect of a searchbot»s intervention type on participants» perceptions about the searchbot and level of engagement with the searchbot' and (RQ3) What are participants» impressions of a dynamic searchbot? Our results suggest that dynamic searchbots can enhance users» collaborative experience and that the intervention type does not greatly affect users» perceptions and level of engagement. Participants» impressions of the searchbot suggest unique opportunities and challenges for future work.

However, prior work has not systematically analyzed how important style is in task-oriented, information-seeking exchanges of the sort we might have with a conversational search agent. We examine recordings from the MISC data set, where pairs of ""users"" and ""intermediaries"" collaborate on information-seeking tasks, and look for indications of style which can be computed at scale. We find that stylistic markers identified by Tannen in casual chat do exist in information-seeking dialogue, and that participants can be arranged along a single stylistic dimension: ""considerate"" to ""involved"". This labelling for style needs no manual intervention. Furthermore, we find that there is no clear best style; but that differences in style, previously thought to impede communication, are only a problem for shorter tasks. This result is likely due to alignment of conversational style over the course of an interaction.

Examination of the discourse allowed commonly used interactions to be identified for Spoken Conversational Search (SCS). We compared the interactions to existing models of search behaviour. We find that SCS is more complex and interactive than traditional search. This work enhances our understanding of different search behaviours and proposes research opportunities for an audio-only search system. Future work will focus on creating models of search behaviour for SCS and evaluating these against actual SCS systems.

We present the participants with four search tasks, each of them designed to represent different cognitive levels of learning. Through quantitative analysis of the participants» Web search logs, we examine how individual search behavior is influenced by different task complexity levels as we present the tasks in a hierarchical order. We also explore how the perceived learning outcomes and processes, and the different learning actions, are related to the levels of cognitive complexity. By analyzing the search logs, self-reports, interview data, and the reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively, we infer that searching and learning are not isolated but co-existing processes. Distinct search patterns and learning outcomes were observed in tasks of different cognitive complexities, and overlapping learning actions were observed for the different tasks.

Query priming employs query auto-completion (QAC) and query suggestion (QS) to present search terms that stimulate critical thinking and encourages careful information seeking and decision making. We conducted an online user study using a crowdsourcing service. Analysis of search behavior logs and questionnaire responses confirmed the following. (1) With query priming, participants issued more queries and (re-)visited search engine result pages more frequently. (2) Query priming promoted webpage selection targeted at evidence-based decision making. (3) The query priming effect varied relative to participant educational background. This study contributes to search interaction design to enhance user engagement in critical thinking in web searches.

We present a study addressing the knowledge gain of users in informational search sessions. Using crowdsourcing, we recruited 500 distinct users and orchestrated real-world search sessions spanning 10 different topics and information needs. By using scientifically formulated knowledge tests we calibrated the knowledge of users before and after their search sessions, quantifying their knowledge gain. We investigated the impact of information needs on the search behavior and knowledge gain of users, revealing a significant effect of information need on user queries and navigational patterns, but no direct effect on the knowledge gain. Users on average exhibited a higher knowledge gain through search sessions pertaining to topics they were less familiar with. Our findings in this paper contribute important ground work towards advancing current research in understanding user knowledge gain through web search sessions.

The physical context creates numerous external factors that play a role in the user's online interactions, thus creating new external biases in the collected information interaction logs. Our general aim is to improve our understanding of onsite users' behavior, which allow us to create better online and onsite contextual suggestion systems. We focus on the cultural heritage domain and have collected onsite users' information interaction logs of visits in a museum. This prompts the question: How to understand users' behavior in order to be able to predict their onsite behaviors? Our main findings are the following: First, users behave differently in different onsite contextual situations. Second, there is a significant dependency between users' onsite behaviors and other users, who are interacting with next point of interests (POIs). Third, we have proposed a contextual Skip-Or-Stay behavior classifier based on four different pairwise contextual features that significantly improves a defined baseline based on all the considered evaluation metrics. Fourth, we have analyzed the importance of different contexts in the Skip-or-Stay behavior predictions.

In this study, we explore the specific assumption that relevant and irrelevant passive highlighting affects comprehension. Participants were divided by cognitive style based on their degree of Field Dependence-Independence [20]. We found that irrelevant highlights had significant negative effects on reading comprehension for Field Independents (FIs), but not Field Dependents (FDs). This is a surprising result because FDs typically rely on external cues to structure and help process information, whereas FIs use internal cues. This suggests that highlighting cues information but does not structure it.

We investigate query characteristics and click behavior on SERPs of children in grades 6 and 8 (ages 11 and 13, respectively). We employ Retrospective Think-Aloud (RTA) protocol to elicit children's thought processes while clicking on results and to identify the sources of information that shaped these processes. We analyze the effect of grade level and task type on query characteristics and click behavior. Early findings show statistical significance across the three tasks in relation to query characteristics and between younger and older children in relation to query entry duration, count of web pages visited and count of result pages clicked on in SERPs. Our study confirms findings reported in previous research, including large-scale search logs studies, and reveals new findings in some areas.

Achieving this decomposition is usually not trivial for non-expert users. Also, the users need additional support to decrease their cognitive workload, regardless of their experience level. A tool designed for a specific task should handle the above issues. In this paper, we present a design approach that can help achieve this, and exemplify this approach using the search task of patent infringement discovery. We apply hierarchical task analysis to analyze a successful goal decomposition scenario for the task. This kind of decomposition makes explicit the tasks that are most responsible for the cognitive workload of the user. We then apply cognitive analysis to reveal the knowledge that enables such decomposition. Finally, we use these findings to design the tool in a way that reduces the load on the user and enables achieving decomposition for non-expert users.

However, finding a good starting point for a search episode in the given structure can still pose a considerable challenge, as users tend to be unfamiliar with exact, complex hierarchical structure. Thus, providing lookahead clues can be of great help and allow users to make better decisions on their search trajectory. In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of users when a recommendation engine is employed along with the browsing tool in an exploratory search system. We make use of an exploratory search system that facilitates browsing by mapping the data on a hierarchical structure. We designed and developed a path recommendation engine as a feature for this system, which given a text query, ranks different browsing paths in the hierarchy based on their likelihood of covering relevant documents. We conduct a user study comparing the baseline system with the featured system. Our main findings are as follows: We observe that, using the baseline system the users tend to explore the data in a breadth-first-like approach by visiting different data points at the same level of abstraction to choose one of them to expand and go deeper. Conversely, with browsing path recommendation (BPR) as a feature, the users tend to drive their search in a more depth-first-like approach by quickly going deep into the data hierarchy. While the users still incline to explore different parts of the search space by using BPR, they are able to restrain or augment their search focus more quickly and access smaller but more promising regions of the data. Therefore, they can complete their tasks with less time and effort

This study is part of a large investigation of the exploitation of useful and important units from retrieved documents to generate rich document surrogates to improve user search experience. We report three user studies using a crowdsourcing platform, where participants were first asked to read an information need and contents of a relevant document and then to perform actions depending on the type of study: i) write important information units (WIIU), ii) highlight important information units (HIIU) and iii) assess importance of already highlighted information units (AIHIU). Further, we discuss a novel mechanism of measuring similarities between content annotations. We find majority agreement of about 0.489 and pairwise agreement of 0.340 among users annotation in the AIHIU study, and average cosine similarity of 0.50 and 0.57 between participant annotations and documents in the WIIU and HIIU studies respectively.

While many systems have been developed to support users' temporal information needs, questions remain over how users utilize these advances to satisfy their needs. Analyzing their search behavior will provide us with novel insights into search strategy, guide better interface and system design and highlight new problems for further research. In this paper we propose a set of search tasks, with varying complexity, that IIR researchers can utilize to study user search behavior in archives. We discuss how we created and refined these tasks as the result of a pilot study using a temporal search engine. We not only propose task descriptions but also pre and post-task evaluation mechanisms that can be employed for a large-scale study (crowdsourcing). Our initial findings show the viability of such tasks for investigating search behavior in archives.

These recommenders generally take a model-based approach which relies on stochastic gradient descent optimization, but it sometimes shows difficulties on hyperparameter optimization and scalability. In order to work around this difficulty, the author considers a completely different approach based on matrix sketching, which is more mathematically tractable and flexible than the existing techniques. More specifically, this paper proposes a new online item recommender inspired by a matrix-sketching-based streaming anomaly detection framework. We discuss its fruitful properties with particular emphasis on the similarities between item recommendation and anomaly detection. Experimental results demonstrate robustness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Existing studies have focused on the criteria seekers employ when choosing information sources, such as sources' accessibility and quality, as well as the contextual factors that shape a seeker's selection. However, existing findings are somewhat conflicting and lack in-depth understanding of the reasons behind individuals' choices. The study reported here invited 53 participants from diverse backgrounds to perform simulated information seeking tasks over a two-day period and to report their experiences and findings in an online logbook. Semi-structured interviews with 23 of them were also conducted in order to examine the issues that arose from the logbooks. Our preliminary findings present several factors associated with participants' choices between impersonal and interpersonal sources. While interpersonal sources are deemed to be more suitable in capturing the context of an information query and providing personalized information, impersonal sources are found to be more accessible under a time constraint while depicting no emotion towards sensitive issues.

Participants were given a 12 minute task time limit and a warning notification when 3 minutes remained. In post-experiment interviews, participants reported two different impacts of the time limit on use of the SG: ten described using the SG as a way to save time given the time limit while five reported less SG use due to uncertainty whether it would contain useful information. Participants also described skimming and reading pages more shallowly, selecting easier to read search results, and bookmarking pages more freely because of the limited time they had to complete the task.

Such an interface allows search systems to engage in a dialogue with users aimed at fulfilling their information needs. One key capability required to make such search dialogues effective is asking clarification questions (CLARQ) proactively, when a user's intent is not clear, which could help the system provide more useful responses. With this in mind, we explore the dialogues between the users on a community question answering (CQA) website as a rich repository of information-seeking interactions. In particular, we study the clarification questions asked by CQA users in two different domains, analyze their behavior, and the types of clarification questions asked. Our results suggest that the types of CLARQ are very diverse, while the questions themselves tend to be specific and require both domain- and general knowledge. However, focusing on popular CLARQ types and domains can be fruitful. As a first step towards automatic generation of clarification questions, we explore the problem of predicting the specific subject of a clarification question. Our findings can be useful for future improvements of intelligent dialog search and question answering systems.

Search effort is an important aspect of Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). Prior findings show that higher cognitive ability searchers tend to perform more actions than lower ability searchers. In an eye-tracking lab study we investigated the effects of working memory (WM) on search effort. The findings show that higher WM searchers perform more actions and that most significant differences are in time spent on reading results pages. We also show that behavior of high and low WM searchers changes differently in the course of a search task performance.

However, visualizations like bar charts are mostly manually designed, static presentations of data without the option of adaption to a user's needs. But so far, it is unknown whether interactivity improves the understanding of charts. In this work, we compare static with dynamic bar charts, which offer an interactive stacking option. We assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction when answering questions regarding the content of a bar chart. An eye-tracker is used to measure the efficiency. We have conducted a between group experiment with 38 participants. While one group had to solve the aggregation tasks using stackable, i.e., interactive bar charts, the other group was limited to static visualizations. Even though new interactive features require familiarization, we found that the stacking feature significantly helps completing the tasks with respect to efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction for bar charts of varying complexity.

Users' wheel activities were extracted from a search log in a user experiment, in which forty participants with different backgrounds conducted an online search in various contexts. To statistically test the potential effects of contexts on browsing strategy, we calculated three types of scroll-based variables to capture different types of browsing behaviors, and analyzed the effects of contextual factors via OLS regression analysis. Our results revealed that information understanding type tasks might lead to more proportion of revisit browsing range, while higher pressure level and higher pre-familiarity might lead to larger one-time browsing range; however, time constraint did not influence their browsing strategies. Our study also provided methodological implication for future interactive information retrieval studies by testifying and highlighting the usefulness of users' wheel activities in depicting online browsing patterns.

It is, therefore, imperative that we identify potential problems with such representation to make the information seeking outcome and the experience more successful. In this paper, we investigate the question quality for the educational community question answering (CQA) site Brainly by examining 2,000 questions, of which 1,000 were answered and 1,000 were unanswered. Two human assessors rated the quality of each question on a scale from 1-5 based on factors such as ambiguity, poor syntax, lack of information, complexity, inappropriateness, and inconsistency. We then identified different textual features that are needed to detect question quality. A logistic regression classifier was built to categorize question features based on the rating scale and textual features present in the question. The results show higher ROC curves for ambiguity, lack of information, inappropriateness, complexity and excessive information; and lower ROC values for poor syntax and inconsistency among the questions. The findings demonstrate that the classifier failed to perform when faced with ill-framed or inconsistent phrases in a question. The work described here presents a method for identifying high and low-quality questions, the knowledge of which could be instrumental in helping reformulate users' questions and present them to a system or a community for more successful processes and outcomes.

The aim of the observational study is to reveal insights into how users would conduct searches over voice where a screen is absent but where users are able to converse interactively with the search system. We conducted alaboratory-based observational study of 13 pairs of participants each completing three search tasks with different cognitive complexity levels. The communication between the pairs was analyzed for interaction patterns used in the search process. This setup mimics the situation of a user interacting with a search system via a speech-only interface.

The aim of this study is to improve indexing by gaining knowledge about users preferred search terms. One clip is from a news program, and two clips come from a literature program. The search terms are categorized according to The Panofsky-Shatford mode/facet matrix. The study shows that specific search terms like named entities are used the most for both genres, and that generic and abstract terms are more important in the literature clips than the news clip. The search terms provided by users were matched with text from the subtitles from the clip, and the results showed that 17%, 32% and 40% of the terms were found for literature clip 1, literature clip 2 and news clip respectively. The percentage was higher when the terms were matched with subtitles from the whole program, and would have been even higher if additional on-screen text was included.

Identifying factors that influence information retrieval skills can help us to understand search behavior and show what skills are required to conduct efficient and accurate searches. This paper describes a study in which relationship factors that influence the information retrieval skills of a cohort of 1,551 Japanese Internet users are investigated using a combination of survey methods, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Our factor analysis confirms the importance of three sub-skill groups that are similar to sub-skill groups that have been previously reported (i.e., formal Internet skills, operational skills, and assessment skills) and indicates the importance of a fourth group (which we call ""search strategy skills""). Our structural equation model incorporates two novel factors that have not previously been studied in this context: critical thinking ability, and self-efficacy for the Internet and information retrieval. The results show that critical thinking ability and self-efficacy positively influence the information retrieval skill level, and age is found to be a negative influence. Contrary to previously reported results, little independent effect is seen from educational attainment.

Relevance judgements are often performed by humans, which makes obtaining them expensive and time consuming. Consequently, relevance judgements are usually performed only on a subset of a given collection of data or experimental results with a focus on the top ranked documents. However, when assessing the performance of exploratory search systems, the diversity or subjective relevance of documents that the user was presented with over a search session are often of more importance than the relative ranking of top documents. In order to perform these types of assessment, all the documents in a given collection need to be judged for relevance. In this paper, we propose an approach based on topic modeling that can greatly accelerate document relevance judgment of an entire document collection with an expert assessor needing to mark only a small subset of documents from a given collection. Experimental results show a substantial overlap between relevance judgments compared to a human assessor.

However, argument spaces can quickly get quite complex and it is very often hard to trace the line of arguments found in literature or social media such as blogs and forums. In this paper, we propose a framework for a decision supporting interactive information retrieval system using methods for argument exploration based on textual documents. This concept is supported by a prototype that focuses on the actual analysis of the retrieved arguments in order to obtain a justified decision. For that we use a simplified argumentation graph with nodes as arguments and simple attacking and supporting relations. A web-based plausibility value is propagated (using ranked-based argumentation semantics) through the network for estimating the quality of the arguments. This is based on a web search for documents that support these arguments. The final decision can further be supported by chosing certain preferred interpretations of an abstract dialectical framework, leading to an integrated view of searching, creating, analysing and deciding.

However, there is a lack of understanding of scholars' annotation needs and behavior. This paper is part of a group of studies aiming to understand how to improve annotation support of AV media, in order to facilitate research activities of media scholars and other scholars who make intensive use of AV media. The main findings confirm previous research discerning stages in media scholars' research processes, and indicate a great variety of research activities which occur in a non-linear order. Our studies also show that different annotation activities occur along those stages. The main contribution of this paper is a generic process model capturing AV media annotation, potentially applicable to a variety of research use cases in a scholarly context.

In this paper, we investigate the identification of focus paragraphs in web pages. Starting from a naive baseline for paragraph and focus paragraph detection, we conducted an eye-tracking study to evaluate the most promising features. We found that single features (mouse position, paragraph position, mouse activity) are less predictive for gaze which confirms findings from other studies. The results indicate that an algorithm for focus paragraph detection needs to incorporate a weighted combination of those features as well as additional features, e.g. semantic context derived from the user's web history.

We provide empirical evidence that both a Tweet's popularity and the presence of links -- even neutral links created by URL shortening services -- may increase a user's belief that the Tweet contains credible information. This is important because the propagation of false information relating to refugees on social media sites has been well documented.

The use of such devices in situations where attention must be divided, such as when walking, are common and research suggests that this increases cognitive load and, therefore, may have an impact on performance. In this work we conducted a laboratory experiment with both phone and tablet devices with the aim of evaluating common mobile situations that cause; fragmented attention, impact search performance and impact on user perception. To do this the distraction level was varied by simulating 3 everyday situations: 1) walking quickly (on a treadmill), 2) navigating a pre-defined route and 3) sitting still (which was used as the baseline condition). The results showed that different experimental conditions had a number of different effects on the participants' perceptions of their own search performance, how hurried they felt and how engaged they were in the tasks.

Results showed that the age-related differences were observed for the fantastic movies domain (for which older adults had significantly lower prior knowledge), whereas the effects of age were not replicated in the health domain (for which older adults had equal knowledge with young adults?). Semantic pre-activation of prior knowledge in the health domain was correlated to more analytic strategies when processing the search engine pages and when navigating.

Dyslexia is a widespread specific learning difficult (SpLD) (10% of any population is estimated to have this cognitive disability) which is under researched in the field of information retrieval. The focus here is an analysis of the User Interface (UI) for search, using visual analytical methods on eye tracking data to examine the difference between control and dyslexic searchers. We use a number of visual analytic methods including path similarity analysis (PSA) and clustering of time intervals to demonstrate both similarities and differences between the user groups. Observations of videos are used to augment the visualizations. Results demonstrate a clear difference between the user groups, and a clear memory effect on the user of search interfaces is shown -- this is a key contribution of this paper. We examine the results using of theories of dyslexia, contributing also to the field of dyslexia and search.

In this study ten participants, who speak English as a second language, were given four search tasks designed to reflect actual information seeking situations. They completed pre- and post-search questionnaires to identify the relevancy of the task, their English language ability and search experience. Our results suggest that, despite a perception that they performed to the best of their abilities, were bookmarking relevant documents and that the given tasks were easy, the students were actually often choosing documents that are only partially or tangentially relevant. The repercussions of this discrepancy are clear and suggest that much more assistance is needed before such services can be made 'digital by default'.

However, while some drawbacks to the shelves as information gateways have been documented, none to our knowledge relate to their capacity for facilitating serendipity. We present findings from a qualitative study of serendipity at the library shelves. This study uncovered a new drawback that we term the ""seeking-encountering tension"". On one hand, this tension entices people towards the relatively high-risk, high-reward activity of exploring new information avenues discovered serendipitously and, on the other, draws them back towards the relative safety of goal-directed information-seeking. We discuss some of the factors that contribute to this tension, and provide design suggestions for mitigating it. Understanding this tension can inform the design of physical and digital information environments that provide users the agency to switch between more and less focused information-seeking at will.

The vision of our project is to develop an assistive technology that is able to support the individual user and enhance the efficiency of an ongoing exploratory search. Such a technical search aid should be able to find out about the user's current interests and goals. Respective parameters can be found in the central and in the peripheral nervous system as well as in overt behavior. Therefore, we aim at using eye movements, pupillometry and EEG to assess respective information. Here, we describe the set-up and the first results of a preliminary user study investigating the effects of searching an image collection on eye movements and pupil dilations. First data show that numbers of fixation, fixation durations as well as pupil dilations differ systematically when looking at a subsequently selected target as compared with not selected items. These results support our vision that further research additionally investigating EEG can in fact result in better predicting the searchers goals and next choices.

However, most of the query suggestion approaches for Intranet search follow an ``one size fits all'' strategy, whereby different users who submit an identical query would get the same query suggestion list. This is problematic, as even with the same query, different users may have different topics of interest, which may change over time in response to the user's interaction with the system. We address the problem by proposing a personalised query suggestion framework for Intranet search. For each search session, we construct two temporal user profiles: a click user profile using the user's clicked documents and a query user profile using the user's submitted queries. We then use the two profiles to re-rank the non-personalised query suggestion list returned by a state-of-the-art query suggestion method for Intranet search. Experimental results on a large-scale query logs collection show that our personalised framework significantly improves the quality of suggested queries.

Researchers model such user interaction behavior in order to understand users and improve search result presentation. In this paper we propose nine different user click models that take various real life search behavior into account. Our main assumption is that users base their clicks primarily on features of document titles, URLs, and snippets over the entire results page, as well as the queries submitted to the search engine and the documents seen previously in their session history. We evaluate our click models by their effectiveness at predicting actual user clicks using standard classification evaluation measures precision, recall, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). We show that incorporating information about the entire results page gives nearly 40% improvement in precision, and including information about the session history along with it increases precision by up to 43%.

However, during their search processes they may discover some useful pieces of information they did not expect. Serendipitous searching occurs when people search for information, but during their search process discover unexpected results. One key aspect of serendipity is chance encountering, which means the accidental and unexpected encountering with useful information. In this paper we address to the chance encounters, search success and search interests of information seekers using a national digital library called Finna. This study shows that chance encountering and search success increase with user satisfaction and that digital libraries can support information encountering.

Ideally, reference summaries for discussion forum threads are created by expert members of the forum community. When there are few or no expert members available, crowdsourcing the reference summaries is an alternative. In this paper we investigate whether domain-specific forum data requires the hiring of domain experts for creating reference summaries. We analyze the inter-rater agreement for both data-sets and we train summarization models using the two types of reference summaries. The inter-rater agreement in crowdsourced reference summaries is low, close to random, while domain experts achieve a considerably higher, fair, agreement. The trained models however are similar to each other. We conclude that it is possible to train an extractive summarization model on crowdsourced data that is similar to an expert model, even if the inter-rater agreement for the crowdsourced data is low.

In cultures where people speak both Chinese and English, using mixed language in oral speaking and web searching is a common phenomenon. While queries are the key element of information retrieval process, mixed-language queries have not yet been adequately studied. This study use query log analysis to examine the query reformulation patterns regarding Chinese-English mixed language queries, and how search intents may affect the query reformulation types users employ. The results can inform IR system designers to enhance cross-language controlled vocabularies and develop discovery platforms for multilingual content, and improve search engines to provide users with more relevant, personalized search results. The findings could also be expanded to other language combinations that would improve search engine designs.

Performing a health search is not a trivial task. A searcher could be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available and the need to understand technical and complex details. Performing a health search collaboratively could increase search efficacy. Sharing health information would encourage discourse. Health search collaboration and information sharing activities in developed countries have been analyzed. However, similar information is not available for health consumers from developing countries. In this work in progress paper, we describe search collaboration and information sharing activities of health consumers in South East Asia.

However, practice and research has shown that there may not always be uniform information access among team members, e.g. in healthcare, government, etc. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a controlled user evaluation to measure the impact of non-uniform information access on CIR outcomes. To address this shortcoming, we conducted a controlled user evaluation using 2 non-uniform access scenarios (document removal and term blacklisting) and 1 full and uniform access scenario. Following this, a design interview was undertaken to provide interface design suggestions. Evaluation results show that neither of the 2 non-uniform access scenarios had a significant negative impact on collaborative and individual search outcomes. Design interview results suggested that awareness of team's query history and intersecting viewed/judged documents could potentially help users share their expertise without disclosing sensitive information. Based on our results we provide important design recommendations to better support users with non-uniform information access in CIR.
